## Motivation

Taking my website to the next level and building out some more useful content.
Since the content will involve a lot of TypeScript, Next, and Tailwind, it makes
the most sense to build the site with the same tools.

### Technology

I'm using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Next.js has a lot of great features
out of the box that are important for my blog, server-side rendering, page
prefetching, dynamic routing, and all the power of
[React](https://reactjs.org/). The server is [Express](https://expressjs.com/),
the database is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), and it runs in a
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

### Structure

My website captures content from several aspects of my life and centralizes it.

- Blog Posts
- Micro blog posts
- Pictures
- GitHub Stars
- Tweets
- Links to interesting websites
- Goals met in games

Each type of content has a card to describe it on the home page, and a permalink url so it can easily be linked to.

In the future, more types of content will be supported as well as different sections of the site dedicated to some of my interests. I'm thinking Magic: The Gathering, D&D, and other projects I'm currently working on.

## Development

```
yarn dev
