I have a Postgres table and I want to output its contents as JSON so I
can have a `.json` file for some tests. Turns out, this is pretty easy.
Let's say the table name is `users`:

    select array_to_json(array_agg(row_to_json(t)))  
    from (  
      SELECT * FROM users
    ) t

And done. That will output the entire `users` table (everything that
matches the `SELECT` query) to a JSON array that you can just drop into
a file.
