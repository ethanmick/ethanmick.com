My friend, who is graduating from undergrad in the spring, lamented to
me about how scarce her GitHub profile was. Some job postings were
asking for her profile, and while she had done a lot of work in her
computer science program, GitHub reflected almost none of that.

And that's a problem with school, isn't it?

My experience in school was similar. At Rochester Institute of
Technology, you would be given programming assignments and expected to
complete them *alone*, without any assistance, to learn the concepts.

Well, except for what you could find online. Or a classmate who was
willing to help. Many times I would complete an assignment and have
someone ask me for help. I'd look at their code, see what was wrong,
give pointers and suggestions, or most importantly, help them improve
their debugging skills.

But none of that shows up on GitHub. Teachers don't want you to post
your code on GitHub because other students could copy you verbatim. But
most likely the assignment is similar to
[other](http://stackoverflow.com/) code that could be copied as well. If
a student is just copying the work (no matter from where), shouldn't
that be obvious on their assessments (like closed book in class exams)?

Even in later years, after the basics of CS and into Software
Engineering classes, where most of the work was project based, we never
put it on GitHub. I must have done over twenty projects in school, and
never once did I get the impression we could host it on GitHub, in
public, for everyone to see our work. Many times it was explicitly
stated that our version control had to be private.

That's disappointing. It's true that if I do a project and host it on
GitHub, then the next class could take a look and copy it.

#### The simple solution is to not give the same project twice.

There's a lot to gain from using powerful open source tools. I would
have loved to use pull requests to review teammates code. Issues to
track bugs and assign them. [Code Coverage](https://coveralls.io/),
[Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/), [Travis
CI](https://travis-ci.org/), and other great tools built around open
source. Rather than using these tools, we ended up using other variants
that weren't as integrated.

Now that I'm [working](https://cloudmine.me/careers/), a lot of my work
ends up being open source. And all of my own fun projects are now [open
source](https://github.com/fastchat/) as well. It's a great way to
easily give back to the community, and it may help someone.

When hiring engineers, we try and look at their published code because
it gives a great idea as to how they work. Everything from how they code
to how they manage their projects. If they have a long history it's
even great to see them learn over the course of their first project to
their most recent.

It's a shame the education world isn't set up for it.

I'd have loved to put my school work on GitHub, so interested people
could see all the work I've done.

For now,

1.  Take the interesting parts of the assignment and publish them after
    the fact. [One
    more](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=bubblesort)
    implementation of bubble sort in python isn't going to hurt.
2.  Try working with your professor to see if current and future
    assignments can be made open source.
3.  Keep working on your fun side projects, and don't be scared to open
    source them. Your idea won't get stolen, and you will probably
    write better code when you know someone else may be looking at it.


There are other solutions too.

1.  Have everyone in the fall semester do project 1, and have everyone
    in the sprint semester *fork* one of those projects, (their choice)
    and expand on it with new requirements.
2.  Have the teams write the same project, but ensure no two languages
    are the same.
3.  Have teams come up with their own projects and implement it.
4.  Make projects more modular based, and expect a finished package when
    complete. Publish it.
