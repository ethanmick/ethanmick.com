When I first started with Node.js, my first HTTP servers were built
using [Express](http://expressjs.com/). Almost all the tutorials use
Express as their server, which I think helps its dominance.

But [Hapi](http://hapijs.com/) beats it hands down. Hapi, out of the box
has:

1. Easier setup with better defaults
2. Better error handling
3. More powerful reply interface
4. Better testability

And that's just scratching the surface.

Let's dive in to some code
([GitHub](https://github.com/ethanmick/hapi-over-express)). All of my
work involves JSON API's so that will be my focus.

#### Hapi

```js
const Hapi = require('hapi')

const port = process.env.PORT || 8080  
const server = new Hapi.Server()

server.connection({ port: port })

server.route({  
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/hello',
  handler: (req, reply) => {
    reply({ hello: req.payload.name })
  }
})

server.start( (err) => {  
  console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri, err ? err : '');
})
```

#### Express

```js
const express = require('express')  
const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

const port = process.env.PORT || 8080  
const app = express()

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }))  
app.use(bodyParser.json())

const router = express.Router()

router.post('/hello', (req, res) => {  
  res.json({ hello: req.body.name })
})

app.use(router)
app.listen(port)  
```

Easier Setup
------------

These are pretty similar. But already I see things I don't like in
Express. It requires an additional dependency to parse out my JSON body,
which is annoying. What else would I be POSTing? A form? That also
requires the `body-parser` dependency!

Hapi, on the other hand, parses both out of the box just fine.

Express's middleware mentality has caused me to have over ten
middleware plugins for my app
([example](https://github.com/fastchat/server)). I don't really want to
deal with middleware for serving a favicon.

Better Error Handling
---------------------

Let's start our Hapi Server:

```bash
$ npm start

> hapi-ethanmick@1.0.0 start /Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/hapi
> node --es_staging index.js

Server running at: http://Ethan-Micks-MacBook-Pro.local:8080  
```

Awesome.

Let's start another one! (In a new shell):

```bash
$ npm start  

> hapi-ethanmick@1.0.0 start /Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/hapi
> node --es_staging index.js

Server running at: http://Ethan-Micks-MacBook-Pro.local:8080
{ [Error: listen EADDRINUSE 0.0.0.0:8080]  
  code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: 'EADDRINUSE',
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '0.0.0.0',
  port: 8080
}
```

How kind! It uses the `err` object in the callback to inform me of an
issue with starting the server.

Express?

    $ npm start

    > express-ethanmick@1.0.0 start /Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/express
    > node --es_staging index.js

    events.js:141  
          throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
          ^

    Error: listen EADDRINUSE :::8080  
        at Object.exports._errnoException (util.js:837:11)
        at exports._exceptionWithHostPort (util.js:860:20)
        at Server._listen2 (net.js:1231:14)
        at listen (net.js:1267:10)
        at Server.listen (net.js:1363:5)
        at EventEmitter.listen (/Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/express/node_modules/express/lib/application.js:617:24)
        at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/express/index.js:23:5)
        at Module._compile (module.js:434:26)
        at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:452:10)
        at Module.load (module.js:355:32)

No such kindness. It throws an exception. Express's `listen` method is
just a simple passthrough to the
[HTTP's](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen_path_callback)
listen method, which doesn't pass in an error in the callback. To fix
this, we need to change the code to:

    app.listen(port, () => {  
        console.log('Server running at:', port)
    }).on('error', err => { console.log('Err!', err) } )

Alright, fine, slightly different syntax. Whatever. Let's fire off 404
request to Express:

    $ http 'http://localhost:8080/random'                     
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found  
    Connection: keep-alive  
    Content-Length: 19  
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8  
    Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2015 20:35:41 GMT  
    X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff  
    X-Powered-By: Express

    Cannot GET /random  

Woh! What!? I want a *JSON API* not a "return anything you want" API!
Express, by default, returns a lovely `text/html` response on a 404.
**Ugh**.

Hapi?

    $ http 'http://localhost:8080/random'                 
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found  
    Connection: keep-alive  
    Date: Tue, 20 Oct 2015 20:35:29 GMT  
    Transfer-Encoding: chunked  
    cache-control: no-cache  
    content-encoding: gzip  
    content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8  
    vary: accept-encoding

    {
        "error": "Not Found", 
        "statusCode": 404
    }

Oh, thank you. (Hapi uses [Boom](https://github.com/hapijs/boom) for its
HTTP errors, which is an excellent package).

Moving on, let's look at the startup options. In Express, you can set
some options when you create the server:

    const app = express({  
        dotfiles: 'ignore',
        redirect: false
    })

Same with Hapi. But what happens if I mistype some?

    const app = express({  
        dotfile: 'ignore',
        redirect: 'ok'
    })

    $ npm start

    > express-ethanmick@1.0.0 start /Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/express
    > node --es_staging index.js

    Server running at: 8080  

Not a peep.

Let's try this in Hapi. Our server now looks like:

    const server = new Hapi.Server({  
        connections: {
            router: {
                isCaseSensitive: false
            }
        },
        debug: {
            log: ['error']
        }
    })

Okay, let's make some honest mistakes:

    const server = new Hapi.Server({  
        connections: {
            routers: {
                isCaseSensitive: 'yes'
            }
        },
        debug: {
            log: 'error'
        }
    })

    $ npm start

    > hapi-ethanmick@1.0.0 start /Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/hapi
    > node --es_staging index.js

    /Users/ethan/Documents/ethanmick/hapi-vs-express/hapi/node_modules/hapi/node_modules/hoek/lib/index.js:731
        throw new Error(msgs.join(' ') || 'Unknown error');
        ^

    Error: Invalid server options {  
      "connections": {
        "routers" [1]: {
          "isCaseSensitive": "yes"
        }
      },
      "debug": {
        "log": "error"
      }
    }

    [1] "routers" is not allowed

Wow! You got really angry. But I love it! It even shows you *where* the
issue was, marked by the [1]. As you fix each issue in your
configuration, the error message catches each one:

**[1] "log" must be an array**
**[1] "isCaseSensitive" must be a boolean**

This stops you from easily passing in an Object with many extraneous
keys (such as a large generic configuration object), but it will
**always, always** catch you mistyping a key, or setting an invalid
value.

Again, behind the scenes, they are using their own powerful
[Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) module, which you should definitely
take a look at.

Replying
--------

Express favors a response object that has many methods on it, such as
`.json` or `.sendFile`. Hapi does two things here. One, their reply
interface is first and foremost a function.

    reply({hello: 'Everyone!'})  

Objects and Arrays are returned as JSON, strings are returned as plain
text. Just what I would expect. But Hapi goes further, and you can
return a whole bunch of clever things:

1.  null
2.  undefined
3.  string
4.  number
5.  boolean
6.  Buffer object
7.  Error object (Formatted to a 500 unless it's a Boom error)
8.  Stream object
9.  Promise object
10. any other object or array

Nice! You can return a Stream and it'll stream the data back to the
user. You can also return a Promise, and when fulfilled, it will send
the result to the user. It makes for some beautiful and elegant code.

The Reply interface can be enhanced with some Plugins (This is annoying,
they used to be built into Hapi), and you can serve [files and
directories](http://hapijs.com/tutorials/serving-files), or
[Proxy](https://github.com/hapijs/h2o2)requests.

Proxying is especially powerful. You can redefine the entire URI and
Headers in your proxy method, which allows you do awesome things, such
as:

1.  Hide S3 resources behind your own authentication
2.  Add OAuth Authentication information to requests and pass them to
    upstream services

Testing
-------

Lastly, I want to touch on testing. Tests are extremely important, and
one thing I've found very hard is to test the *controller* part of my
code. I have all my logic separated into a model layer, but I still want
to ensure my controllers have code coverage and work as expected.

How can I do that in Express? Maybe
[this](http://www.designsuperbuild.com/blog/unit_testing_controllers_in_express/)?
Or
[this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8831984/how-do-i-test-my-express-app-with-mocha)?
I've used [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) in the
past, but it's clunky and inelegant.

Hapi to the rescue. Change the end of our file to:

    //server.start( (err) => {
    //    console.log('Server running at:', server.info.uri, err ? err : '');
    //})

    var req = {  
        method: 'POST',
        url: '/hello',
        payload: JSON.stringify({name: 'Ethan'})
    };

    server.inject(req, res => {  
        console.log('Tested!', res.statusCode, res.result);
    });

Run it and get: `Tested! 200 { hello: 'Ethan' }`

Hapi has a built in `inject` method that allows you to, well, inject an
HTTP request into the server. It gets routed like a normal request to
the correct route handler, which then executes as normal. The result
object in our test has the information that we can validate in a test.
You can see how I fully test a server in my example
[hapi-starter](https://github.com/ethanmick/hapi-starter).

### Last Thoughts

There are some other things which I really like about the Hapi Project.
I like how aggressively they move forward. They just released version
[11](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/releases). They follow semantic
versioning, but aren't *afraid* to release a major new version with
breaking changes.

They supported IO.js from the very beginning and when Node 4 came out
they released [Hapi 10](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/issues/2764):

> hapi v10.0.0 contains no breaking changes. It is published to indicate
> the transition from node v0.10 to node v4.0. Moving to v10.0.0 only
> requires upgrading your node version to the latest v4. Future releases
> of the hapi v10 branch will include internal changes to take advantage
> of the new features available in node v4 and those will break under node
> v0.10.

I love the versioning, and their unabashed movement toward a better API.
On the other side, you have Express, which released it's latest major
version on on [Apr 9,
2014](https://github.com/strongloop/express/releases/tag/4.0.0).

So there you have it. I've been using Hapi for over 2 years now and
always have been impressed with it. It's definitely worth a try for
your next project!
