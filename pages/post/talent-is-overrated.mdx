I just finished reading *Talent is Overrated* by Geoff Colvin. He
debunks the idea that people have an "innate" talent toward something,
and most people will only be "so good". Rather, the concept of
**Deliberate Practice** is described, in which an intense,
repeatable, and focused activity is applied toward achieving their goal
in a domain.

The most disheartening thing I felt like was that some options have
indeed been closed to me. I probably cannot become the Chess Grandmaster
in the world, because I, being 24, am at least two decades behind on the
practice I would need.

However, it was truly enlightening to how I can become *much* better in
the domains I am interested in, through deliberate practice. And so I
shall.
