I recently had to decrypt a bunch of PDF's. I knew the password, but
didn't want to do them one at a time. Luckily, some quick scripting did
the trick.

    brew update && brew install qpdf  

Fire up your favorite text editor (I named the file `decrypt.sh`):

    #!/bin/bash

    DECRYPTED_FOLDER="decrypted"  
    mkdir $DECRYPTED_FOLDER

    for f in *.pdf  
    do  
        qpdf --decrypt --password="$1" "$f" "$DECRYPTED_FOLDER/$f"
    done  

Give it some power: `chmod +x decrypt.sh`

Make sure the script is in the same directory as the PDF's you want to
convert. It'll make a new directory called "decrypted" and dump the
PDF's into it.

    ./decrypt.sh pdfPasswordHere

For example:

    ./decrypt.sh awesomesauce

Enjoy decrypting!
