1. Read more. Read 12 books, one per month. More importantly, find a way to
   make it a habit. It’ll be a quiet, alone time. Enjoy it.
2. Write more. Not all of it needs to be public, but writing will help get
   thoughts down. Write about business, life, problems, solutions. Learn
   how to write concisely and clearly.
3. Live healthier. Drink a little less and exercise a little more. Pay
   attention to the numbers that are important and focus on them.
4. Cook tastier. Cooking should elevate and make the moment magical. Put
   away the electronics and focus on doing something well. Balance
   elaborate with efficient and effective, not ever meal will need to be fancy.
5. Work smarter. Spend time where it needs to be spent and ensure the important
   tasks are done well.
6. Seek happiness. Unexpected things come all the time - take a step back and
   think about how they might bring you joy. Indulge if so, remove if not.

I have some other goals as well, but these are the public ones.
