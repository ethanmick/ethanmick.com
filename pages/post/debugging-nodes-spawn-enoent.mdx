Just figured out a bug that was really annoying. I was running a shell
command from Node, and it was working fine in some cases, but failed for
my new test with the cryptic error:

    spawn /bin/sh ENOENT  

That was it. But of course `/bin/sh` exists, so what's going on?

Turns out, this error means *something* doesn't exist, not `/bin/sh`.
It turns out that the `cwd` I was setting the command to was incorrect,
and in fact, didn't exist.

So when this occurs, check to see what variables are undefined when you
don't expect them to be.
