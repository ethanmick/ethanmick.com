I recently wanted to create a Gif from some burst images and already had FFmpeg
installed on my Mac. Surely the audacious tool can create a Gif from the
images. Turns out, it can!

This was done using FFmpeg `3.1.2`, although any `3.x` version should work.

First, get all your burst images onto your Mac into a folder. I used _Image
Capture_, found the images, and imported them all to a new folder.

Now, when imported straight from the iPhone, the names will be
something like: IMG_3244.JPG. It's important that these are in the correct
order you want your Gif to be in. It's also important that there are no breaks
in the sequence. If there are, you need to rename the images so that the
numbers don't have any gaps in them. (So if you have IMG_3244.JPG,
IMG_3245.JPG, and IMG_3247.JPG, rename the last one to IMG_3246.JPG).

Once your images are in the correct order, fire up your terminal and cd to the
directory.

```bash
ffmpeg -f image2 -framerate 9 -start_number 3244 -i IMG_%4d.JPG -vf scale=531x299,transpose=1,crop=299:431:0:100 out.gif
```

There are two things you may need to change:

1. The `IMG_%4d.JPG` maps to your image names, where the `4` is how many digits there are. If your images are named `IMG_534.JPG`, you'd want `%3d`.
2. The `-start_number 3244` maps to the first image number you have, so you'll want to change that.

There you go! You now have a Gif named `out.gif` that you can share with your friends.
