Newer versions of FFmpeg are awesome. To make sure you have all the
goodies for HTML 5 video (for OS X):

```bash
brew install ffmpeg --with-libvpx --with-libvorbis
```

or if you already had it installed:

```bash
brew reinstall ffmpeg --with-libvpx --with-libvorbis
```

Then, to convert a video to .mp4:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4v out.mp4
```

or WebM:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.m4v output.webm
```

So easy!

Of course, I had a lot of videos I wanted to convert. So I wrote up a
little bash script.

    # convert.sh
    for i in *.m4v;
      do name=`echo $i | cut -d'.' -f1`;
      echo $name;
      ffmpeg -ss 00:00:05 -i "$i" -frames:v 1 "./output/$name.png"
      ffmpeg -i "$i" "./output/$name.mp4";
      ffmpeg -i "$i" "./output/$name.webm";
    done

This requires there to be an *output* folder in the directory for the
script to place the result in. This will not only convert every file to
MP4 and WebM, but it also makes an image of the video at second 5. Why
5? Because sometimes the videos were black for the first few seconds, so
I had to go into them a little bit. This can be great for using the new
`<video>` element in HTML, and having a Poster image.
