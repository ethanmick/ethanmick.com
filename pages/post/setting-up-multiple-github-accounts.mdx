I recently setup a second GitHub account for some personal unrelated
use. I wanted a new project to use that account instead of my default
one. I added the origin as normal and tried to push:

    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:my-new-account/project.git
    $ git push -u origin master

    ERROR: Permission to my-new-account/project.git denied to ethanmick.
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

Whoops! Okay, wait, yeah. This makes sense. I hadn't setup any SSH
authentication for my new account yet, and didn\'t want to use HTTPS.
I'll just create a new SSH key and add it to my new account. Following
[GitHub's
docs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
I quickly create a new key and add it to my account. Cool, show time.

    $ git push -u origin master

    ERROR: Permission to my-new-account/project.git denied to ethanmick.
    fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

    Please make sure you have the correct access rights
    and the repository exists.

Wait a moment, this is how it should work! What gives? Okay, so instead
of sending the correct SSH key on the request, it's still sending the
key associated with my main account. I need to fix the request to send
the right key.

Some searching around gets me there. I can edit my `~/.ssh/config` file
to send the correct SSH key in the request to the host I want, in this
case, GitHub.com.

    # Main Account
    Host ethanmick
    User git
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    # New Project
    Host my-new-account
    User git 
    HostName github.com
    PreferredAuthentications publickey
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new_account

Next, I need to edit the origin URL to tell it to use this new
configuration:

    $ git remote set-url origin git@my-new-account:my-new-account/project.git

Instead of using `github.com` as the host, set it to the value of the
`Host` field in the SSH config. This tells the request to use the values
in that SSH configuration, correctly pointing to the new SSH key. It
will now push!

However, there was one more gotcha. When I pushed to the new repo, with
the new SSH Key, Git still used my globally configured username and
email! This meant GitHub thought the commits were coming from my old
account! Time to set that to the values on GitHub:

    git config --local user.name "New Account"
    git config --local user.email "email@example.com"

And then everything worked perfectly.
