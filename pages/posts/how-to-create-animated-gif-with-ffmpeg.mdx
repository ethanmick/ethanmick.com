There are times when sharing a GIF is easier and more convenient than sharing
a video file. With the right compression it often will be smaller too. You
can easily use FFmpeg to convert a video file to a gif.

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=720:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" -loop 0 output.gif
```

- `fps` sets the frame rate. I found about 15 to give a quality gif while keeping a small size.
- `scale` will resize the output to the pixels wide and automatically determine the height while preserving the aspect ratio. 720 had good quality.
  - `lanczos` is the scaling algorithm
- `split` has everything done in one command.
- `loop` determines how the GIF loops.
  - 0 is infinite looping
  - -1 is no looping
  - 1 will loop once, so it would play twice.

And that's it!
