I just finished reading [Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a
Fantastic Future](http://amzn.to/1NDH1m5) by Ashlee Vance.

I enjoyed the book and recommend you read it. It gives a good look at
where Elon Musk came from and how that has impacted how he works and the
man he is today. It also ran through the trials and tribulations of his
companies, which was enlightening.

Elon Musk is my hero. I follow what he he does closely and try to read
as much as I can about him, staying up to date on his companies. Because
of that, I did feel like I had read a lot of these passages before,
almost word for word. But if you've just kept a stray on on Musk, this
book is sure to get you interested in more.

### Takeaways

I like to try and change my behavior from reading books - to make myself
a better person. After reading about Musk's work ethic and how hard he
fought to get to where he is, I decided to change my work ethic too.

1.  I'm going to cut back on video games. Even though Musk himself
    played them, I feel like I play too much, and am squandering
    potential. While it's better than watching TV, doing #2 will be
    even better.
2.  I'm going to read more. Musk read voraciously, and it allowed him
    to become a subject matter expert very quickly. I'm going to spend
    more time reading, at least one book every other week, and post
    about them on this blog.
3.  I'm going to meet new people. I've spent too much of my time not
    going out and finding new friends. I'm going to look for events in
    Boston and hang out. If you're in the area, feel free to send me a
    message to meet for coffee!
