cURL is an incredibly powerful tool when working on the web, but getting
started (and being useful) with it can take some time. I'm going to
walk through what I do with cURL 95% of the time.

At its very basic, cURL makes requests to URL's. Normally you want to
interact with those URL's in someway.

```bash
curl www.google.com
```

By default, cURL makes an HTTP GET request, so that will fetch the HTML
from www.google.com. Awesome!

Spitting it out in the terminal isn't so useful, so let's save it to a
file:

```
curl -o google.html www.google.com
```

Looking at `google.html` will show you the same contents as before. This
is especially useful when you want to save a JSON response.

Great! Well, interacting with HTML is pretty boring, most of what I do
is interacting with API's. cURL is a great way for quickly testing your
PHP script, your JSON endpoint, or what that API actually returns.

I worked at [CloudMine](https://cloudmine.me/) and we had a decent [JSON
API](https://cloudmine.me/docs/api), so I'll use that just as an
example. Just keep in mind that the URL isn't important here, but
rather the curl options.

By default, curl makes GET requests, so let's GET some data!

    curl https://api.cloudmine.me/v1/app/928a78ffd73e4ff78383d1d4c06dd5a7/text?keys=all

Woh! What?

```json
{ "errors": ["API Key invalid"] }
```

Oh, CloudMine expects an API Key to be sent as well. As an additional
header? Sure, no problem:

    curl https://api.cloudmine.me/v1/app/928a78ffd73e4ff78383d1d4c06dd5a7/text \
    -H X-CloudMine-ApiKey:e90ef1aeaadd48de93b45038ed592a06

Response:

```json
{"success":{},"errors":{}}`
```

Excellent! Sending the correct header worked. But the response is rather
vague, I'm not sure if it worked and found no data, or it didn't work
and didn't return an error. Let's examine the headers on the reply:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudmine.me/v1/app/928a78ffd73e4ff78383d1d4c06dd5a7/text \
-H X-CloudMine-ApiKey:e90ef1aeaadd48de93b45038ed592a06 -i
```

Response:

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sat, 20 Dec 2014 17:31:10 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Status: 200 OK
X-Request-Id: a9fbdaec-3b3c-4b11-92d8-5af2e9f01e8e
Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate
X-Runtime: 0.020247
X-Rack-Cache: miss
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: X-Request-Id

{"success":{},"errors":{}}
```

Adding `-i` will return all the headers on the response. If you _only_
want the headers, you can use `-I`.

Excellent. But the URL I want to hit is actually an endpoint for
consuming data. I want to _send_ information. Let's make a POST
request!

````bash
curl -X POST https://api.cloudmine.me/v1/app/928a78ffd73e4ff78383d1d4c06dd5a7/text \
-H X-CloudMine-ApiKey:e90ef1aeaadd48de93b45038ed592a06 -i

{"errors":[{"code":400,"message":"Invalid payload"}]}
```

Oops, we forgot to send data. To send information, we use `-d`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.cloudmine.me/v1/app/928a78ffd73e4ff78383d1d4c06dd5a7/text \
  -d '{"myrandomkey":{"name":"ethan"}}' \
  -H X-CloudMine-ApiKey:e90ef1aeaadd48de93b45038ed592a06 \
  -H "content-type:application/json"
```

Response:

```json
{ "success": { "myrandomkey": "created" }, "errors": {} }
````

CloudMine expects the Content-Type to be explicitly stated, so we add
that as a header too. Other common ones are `application/xml` and
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Cool. Well, I don't like that object, so let's delete it.

````bash
curl -X DELETE "https://api.cloudmine.me/v1/app/928a78ffd73e4ff78383d1d4c06dd5a7/data?keys=myrandomkey" \
-H X-CloudMine-ApiKey:e90ef1aeaadd48de93b45038ed592a06
```

Response:

```json
{ "success": { "myrandomkey": "deleted" }, "errors": {} }
````

Welp, there it goes.

That's 95% of what I do with cURL. Some other useful options to know
are:

`-d @./path/to/file` Will send the information in the file as the body
of the request. Great when POSTing large amounts of data.

`-L` The request will follow any redirects it gets. Useful for when
site's redirect you from `url/` to `url`.

`-u username:password` Useful for going through HTTP Basic
authentication.

`-v` Makes the request verbose, which you should always do when
submitting a cURL request and response to a support person.

Lastly, sometimes your terminal will do funky things with the URL to
escape it. If you don't like this, just put the text in quotes. cURL
will respect it either way.
