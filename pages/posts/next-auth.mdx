When building a Software as a Service product, one of the first pieces to make
is the authentication flow. It's essential to get the user to sign in to use the
product so you can save data between sessions. It also provides a good
understanding of how interested a person is in your product. Authentication
provides a little friction and is an integral part of the funnel.

In the past years, authentication has gotten easier as frameworks have matured
and solid libraries have been created.

My current favorite stack for building SaaS is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
It has fantastic TypeScript support and a great community. This community has
created many useful libraries. When making a product, you should stick to what
you know to limit how much you need to learn. Building something people want is
hard enough without learning a bunch of new tech on top.

The best library for authentication with Next.js is
[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/). It provides a simple way to get
started and quickly get a secure session with your web app.

NextAuth.js can use database sessions or JWT tokens. A database session stores
information in the database and each request is checked against the saved
session. A JWT is an encrypted token that the server reads, protecting
information there. Because it's quicker to get started, this guide uses a JWT.

In your [Next.js app](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started), start with
installing the packages:

```bash
yarn add -SE next-auth
```

Next, create an API route that will handle the authentication calls. Create a
file at:

```bash
pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
```

The filename is important here; it's what NextAuth.js expects the variable to be
named. This file is a regular API route for Next, but you will pass off most of
the logic to the NextAuth.js library. It has handlers to handle logging in,
logging out, showing the correct pages, etc. So instead of exporting a default
handler, we export the libraries handler.

```ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth'
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'

export default NextAuth({
  session: {
    strategy: 'jwt',
  },
  providers: [
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: 'Sign in',
      credentials: {
        username: { label: 'Username', type: 'text', placeholder: 'username' },
        password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password' },
      },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        // Handle Auth!
        const user = { id: 1, username: 'Ethan', email: 'test@test.com' }
        return user
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

This code does all the heavy lifting for creating your full authentication flow.
The only provider you are using is the `CredentialsProvider`, which allows you to
customize the authentication method. The login page will ask for a username and
password, and those will be available in the credentials object passed to
authorize.

You could look up the user in a database and compare the passwords using the
library [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).

If you return `null` in `authorize`, the user will get an invalid credential
message. Likewise, if you throw an error, the user will be sent to the error
page. To test the sign-in, go to [http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin](http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin)! Since
we don't validate the username and password in the above code, anything will log
the user in.

## Using the Session

Once the user has logged in, using the session client-side is done with a hook.

```tsx
import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

export const Component = () => {
  const { data: session } = useSession()
  return <></>
}
```

The session variable will hold the details of the user.

```json
{
  "expires": "2022-06-26T13:07:18.887Z",
  "user": {
    "email": "test@test.com"
  }
}
```

## Customizing the JWT

The only other part of this flow I found very frustrating was once the user was
logged in, I wanted some critical information stored in the JWT. By default,
that is:

- `name: string`
- `email: string`
- `image: string`

Okay... but I need a primary key for the user. When using the session
client-side, I want to be able to fetch "All resources for the user with ID X,"
not by email.

You can add a configuration option to NextAuth.js function way above that allows
you to configure the session JWT:

```ts
callbacks: {
  async session({ session, token }) {
    return {
      ...session,
      user: {
        ...session.user,
        id: parseInt(token.sub || '', 10),
      },
    }
  },
},
```

The `token.sub` is the User ID from the `authorize` method above as a string. If
your primary key is a UUID then that will work fine. Otherwise, change it back
to a number.

## Set the Environment Variables

Lastly, you should set two environment variables that NextAuth.js uses:

```
# This is used to encrypt the JWT
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=secret_phrase_here

# This is the root URL to your application
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

To generate the secret, run:

```bash
OpenSSL rand -hex 32
```

Congrats! Now you have a fully functioning authentication flow! You can use
helper methods to create your login page that fits your design better.
Registering users is out of scope for NextAuth.js, but a simple form can pass the
information to your backend.
