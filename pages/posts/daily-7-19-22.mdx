Early in life and in your career, it is vital to _learn how to learn_. This fact
is counterintuitive to what you are taught in school; that you must learn from
teachers. If you can _only_ learn from someone else, then you will be a burden on
those people. You'll find excuses for not getting things done. You'll slip into
a fixed mindset instead of having a growth mindset.

Learning to learn frees you from all that. The limitation becomes time, which is
a limitation, but you can also learn to manage your time.
