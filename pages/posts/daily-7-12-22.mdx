I've stolen the concept of a [brag sheet](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)
from Julia Evans. Every Friday, I spend a couple of minutes reflecting on what I
did at work that week. Not only does it help during performance evaluations, but
it also centers my thinking around what I actually got done.

If you find yourself not having much to write down, consider:

1. Write down everything! You do amazing things, even if you don't think they are that great.
2. Are you working on what's important? Is that evident?

As a manager, I remind my team weekly with a Slack reminder to update their brag
sheets. Their success is my success!
