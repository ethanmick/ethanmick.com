In the last section, you learned how to pass information to components with
props. These props are read-only. They cannot change, which is a real bummer
since you want to add to-dos to your application. While `props` are read-only,
the _state_ is mutable.

Modern React has its own way of handling state. This will bring you through a
journey of learning about hooks and component lifecycle. There are third-party
libraries you can use to help manage state, but they all use the same principles
you will learn here.

For now, the idea is to use the tools React provides to finally make the app
mutable.

Onward!

## Hooks

Hooks are new in React 16. A hook is a function that has some unique properties
in the React lifecycle, depending on which hook you are using.

The hook we will start with is `useState`, which creates a constant value
representing the current value, and a setter to change it. The syntax for it is:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

const [name, setName] = useState<string>('')
```

The TypeScript type in `< >` defines the type. TypeScript can infer many types
so it is not strictly necessary. However, you will find it useful when handling
more complicated objects and arrays. The `const` defines these variables as
constant, you cannot change them in the execution of the function. The function
`useState` returns an array with two variables, the current value of the state
and a function that will change that state. In modern JavaScript, you should
always destructure these into their parts. Name them anything you want, such as
`[user, setUser]`.

### What's in a name?

The function you call from React is `useState`, which really could have been
named _anything_. There is nothing unique about the name except convention.
React uses the prefix `use` to define a function as a hook. Hooks have unique
properties and by following this prefix your linter and tools can help ensure
your code follows those guidelines.

### But why hooks?

This might seem overly complicated. In class-based projects, you would have
something more like:

```tsx
class MyComponent {
  public name: string = ''
}
```

And the DOM would use `value` in some way, perhaps changing it on a button click.

```tsx
<button onclick={() => (component.name = 'Ethan')}>Button</button>
```

This isn't how React works. The markup and state live in the same function, and
that function is _stateless_. It doesn't have a `this` property or a way to keep
any data around _after_ it returns. The function runs and returns the value. How
do you add state to a stateless function?

You do that with hooks. To understand hooks better, you need to understand the
component lifecycle.

## Component Lifecycle

Modern React uses stateless components for everything. Using hooks, you can tap
into the lifecycle methods you need to manage this lifecycle. You'll learn the
details of these later, but it's important to understand the basics of the
stateless lifecycle.

Take the following example component:

```tsx
const ExampleComponent = ({ name }) => {
  console.log('Rendered', new Date())
  return <span>{name}</span>
}
```

When the application starts, all components are _unmounted_ to start. They have
never been rendered before.

The first time the component is mounted, it will be rendered for the first time.
This will be the first time `Rendered` is executed.

Whenever the `name` prop changes, this component will re-render, executing
`Rendered` again with the new time.

When you add state to a component, you add another trigger to cause the
component to re-render.

```tsx
const ExampleComponent = ({ label }) => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  console.log('Rendered', new Date())
  return (
    <div>
      <label>{label}</label>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

Anytime the `label` prop changes, this code will run again. Anytime the input
changes it will update the `name`, this code will run again.

The magic of `useState('')` is that the default value of `''` is only respected
the first time this component is mounted. If the label were to change and the
code ran again, the state would not revert to the empty string. It keeps
whichever value it was last set to.

Finally, when you no longer render the component then the component is
unmounted.

## Learning `useState`

```tsx
const [name, setName] = useState('')
```

Each time the component renders, the first parameter (`name`, above) will hold
the _current value_ for the state. If you want to change it, you cannot simply
do:

```tsx
name = 'Ethan'
```

1. The variables are declared as `const` above, and cannot be changed.
2. Even if you changed the above to be `var` instead of `const` the changed
   value won't stick around. When the function renders again, the value will be the
   original value.

Instead of changing the `name` directly, the second parameter returned by
`useState` is the setter for the value. You call this function to _set_ the
state. This will cause the component to re-render, and when it does, the state
will have the new value.

This is how, in an entirely stateless function, you can track state.

### Other Hooks

There are other hooks that you will learn about in future chapters. These hooks
tie into the lifecycle of components. You can also build custom hooks that use
hooks, allowing for complex behavior to be modeled simply.

## State in the to-do app

Anything that changes is state. In your to-do app, there will be two things that
change.

1. The user will input a string that will be for a new to-do. The user typing
   the strings is tracked as state.
2. The to-dos themselves. The user can add and complete (remove) to-dos.

You'll start with the first and work toward the second.

### User Input

The user needs to enter a new to-do in a text field. A text field can be
**controlled** or **uncontrolled** in React. Uncontrolled is any user input that
is not wired up to React. This is the default, but it makes it very hard to get
the value from the input.

To make that easier, React lets you control the input.

To do that with a text field, you will _pull_ the state out of the input and
store it in an external place.

```tsx
// Uncontrolled, no way to know what the user typed
<input type="text" />

// Controlled, pull the state out.
const [text, setText] = useState('')
// In your JSX
<input type="text" value={text} onChange={ (e) => setText(e.target.value) } />
```

This puts the value of the `input` in the state of `text`. Once you've done
that, you can easily access the value and store it.

To manage this state, it's a good idea to toss it into a new component.

```tsx
const AddTodo = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('')

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button>Add</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This component set's up the `input` state and tracks it when the user types in
the text box. Then, it has a button that when clicked should trigger the to-do
to be added to the list.

You can use this component in your to-do list component:

```tsx
const TodoList = ({ todos }: TodoListProps) => (
  <div>
    <AddTodo />
    <ul>
      {todos.map(({ text }, index) => (
        <TodoListItem key={index} text={text} />
      ))}
    </ul>
  </div>
)
```

This will show the input and button at the top of the list. You can also put it
at the bottom if you prefer.

It's time to add state to the To-do list as well. Up until this point, you've
been working on a hard-coded set of to-dos. This has let you test and build your
application quickly, but it's not a real to-do app until you can add your own.

<Callout>
  üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Don't be afraid to hardcode things to test. It also can be useful for your product! Almost all
  to-do apps have some default items when you first open the app that acts as a tutorial. What you
  just build mimics that and is useful for your product!
</Callout>

The state you need to add is the array of `Todo`s. Instead of passing those in
as immutable props, the list will manage their to-dos. This makes sense from a
product perspective because a user may have many different to-do lists.

So instead of passing in the to-dos, you add state for them:

```tsx
const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([])
```

Since the array is empty to start (feel free to add defaults if you want),
TypeScript doesn't know what the objects in the array will be. You solve that by
adding the generic `<Todo[]>` code, which tells TypeScript this array will be of
`Todo` objects.

Then you can simply use them like the prop! The final component looks like:

```tsx
const TodoList = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([])
  return (
    <div>
      <AddTodo />
      <ul>
        {todos.map(({ text }, index) => (
          <TodoListItem key={index} text={text} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This is good, but you still can't add a new to-do to your list. To do that, you
need to handle events.

### The fallacy of state

React provides simple primitives to manage state. The state of your application
is simple to start but will grow more complex. A more complex state is harder to
manage.

Managing state is going to be the root of all your problems. React `props` are
easy; they are immutable and don't change. If your application was _only_
properties it would be very easy to reason about. It also would not be very
interesting. Nothing would change. State brings power, but that power brings
complexity.

## Events

Events are how your application can respond to incoming messages. An event may
be a keypress, a button click, or incoming data. These events are handled with
_event handlers_ or functions that you define to handle the event. React will
pass the event to your handler and you can handle it.

You've already used an event; the `onChange` event above on the `input` field.
Every time the input changes, which happens when the user types, the `onChange`
event triggers.

```tsx
;(e) => setText(e.target.value)
```

Your simple handler takes the event, gets the `target`, and gets the value of
that target. The target is where the event came from. In this case, that is the
`input` field itself. And the value, therefore, is the current value on that
input field, or what the user just typed! You set that to your state with
`setText`.

React manages the event itself; that's a `React.Event` but the target attribute
points to a regular HTML input field, and you can read about the various
attributes on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input#attr-value).

## Adding the to-do

To tie this together, you want to add the to-do to your list when the user
clicks the button. To handle button clicks, you want to implement an `onClick`
handler.

```tsx
const AddTodo = ({}: AddTodoProps) => {
  const onClick = () => {
    onAddTodo(text)
    setText('')
  }
  // Rest of the code ...
}
```

When the user clicks `Add`, then you want to:

1. Add the to-do to the list
2. Set the input text to be blank again

Setting the text is easy, you already know how to set the text! You just call
`setText('')` and that will set it on the next render.

<Callout>
  üê¢ React will not re-render the component immediately. When you change state then React will
  re-render the component at its next earliest convenience.
</Callout>

This component doesn't have the list of to-dos though. The parent component
does. How do you tell the parent ‚ÄúHey, I have a to-do for you to add!‚Äù? With a
custom event handler! Here, your event handler will function as a JavaScript
callback. You'll pass the function into your component and wait for a to-do to
be added. Then you'll call the function with that to-do!

```tsx
const TodoList = ({}: TodoListProps) => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([])

  const onAddTodo = (text: string) => {
    setTodos((todos) => [...todos, { text }])
  }

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <AddTodo />
      <ul>
        {todos.map(({ text }, index) => (
          <TodoListItem key={index} text={text} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

You define a regular function named `onAddTodo`, which expects a string
parameter passed. When you set the state, you want to use the _previous_ state
to set the new one. You want to add a to-do to your list. That's what
`[...todos, { text }]` does. This uses a slightly different syntax for
`setState`:

```tsx
setTodos([...todos, { text }])
// vs
setTodos((todos) => [...todos, { text }])
```

The first uses the `todos` that are defined above, with `useState`. This version
may be stale though. So to ensure you are using the most updated list of to-dos,
you should use the second syntax. This passes the current state value to a
function, and you reference that instead.

### Wire it up

The only thing left to do is wire it up!

```tsx
const AddTodo = ({ onAddTodo }: AddTodoProps) => {
  const onClick = () => {
    onAddTodo(text)
    setText('')
  }
}
```

```tsx
<AddTodo onAddTodo={onAddTodo} />
```

You should try to keep the names the same if you can. Only change the names of
handlers if you need to disambiguate.

It should now work! You should be able to add to-dos to your list.

## Mastering state and events

Managing state and responding to events take your static site and turn it into a
real web app. It brings it to life and lets you really use it. You should be
able to take this app and bring it with you, writing down your to-dos.

React provides simple primitives to manage state, which will take you very far.
You'll learn how even these simple hooks let you manage complex state
throughout your application.
