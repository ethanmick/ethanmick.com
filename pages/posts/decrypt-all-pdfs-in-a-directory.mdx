I recently had to decrypt a bunch of PDF's. I knew the password, but
didn't want to do them one at a time. Luckily, some quick scripting did
the trick.

```bash
brew update && brew install qpdf
```

Fire up your favorite text editor (I named the file `decrypt.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash

DECRYPTED_FOLDER="decrypted"
mkdir $DECRYPTED_FOLDER

for f in *.pdf
do
    qpdf --decrypt --password="$1" "$f" "$DECRYPTED_FOLDER/$f"
done
```

Give it some power: `chmod +x decrypt.sh`

Make sure the script is in the same directory as the PDF's you want to
convert. It'll make a new directory called "decrypted" and dump the
PDF's into it.

```bash
./decrypt.sh pdfPasswordHere
```

For example:

```bash
./decrypt.sh awesomesauce
```

Enjoy decrypting!
