Patrick McKenzie had a [great tweet the other
day](https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1544231745439952897):

> Don't do things that don't matter, as an individual or as an organization.

It's hard to know what "what matters" and what doesn't. Lately, I've been
thinking about that as free time will shift quite dramatically. Things that
matter would move me closer to my goals and fulfill me. That can be hard when
those goals change too.

I think a system to help me evaluate will be more useful here, so that's what
I'll spend some time thinking about.
