When building a web app, you will often find yourself in need of a database.
There are several to choose from and many places to host them, but one of the
best and cheapest is running [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) on a
virtual private server (VPS). It's a low effort way to add persistence to your
application and works effectively
with apps running on the server.

The steps to install PostgreSQL and get it running are pretty straightforward.
You will need root access to the server to install the database. The first step
is to add the PostgreSQL repo to the machine so you can install different
versions. The default Ubuntu package is often out of date, and it is best to
install the latest version.

```bash
# Create the file repository configuration:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'

# Import the repository signing key:
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

# Update the package lists:
sudo apt-get update

# Install the latest version of PostgreSQL.
# If you want a specific version, use 'postgresql-12' or similar instead of 'postgresql':
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-14
```

Congratulations! You now have PostgreSQL running on Ubuntu. When you change a
configuration, you will need to restart the service.

```bash
# Restart
service postgresql restart

# Stop
service postgresql stop

# Start
service postgresql start
```

You can find the configuration files in this directory when you need to make
changes:

```bash
/etc/postgresql/14/main/
```

## Setting up a Database

After setting up a database, a common next step is to create credentials for
your application. You don't want to use the default postgres user for this.
Instead, you should create a new user, a database, and grant permission to
access it. You can do that with the following commands:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE name_of_database;
CREATE USER name_of_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secret_password_here';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE name_of_database TO name_of_user;
```

The above commands will create a database and a user. Then, it will grant the
user the permissions it needs to work with that database. The last line gives
all permissions, but you can
[grant](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/sql-grant.html) a subset.

The new user will not be able to log in because PostgreSQL limits the
connections to a Unix socket by default. Your application most likely will need
to connect with a regular password, so you should update the connection method:

Open `/etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf` and change the last line marked here:

```conf
# DO NOT DISABLE!
# If you change this first entry you will need to make sure that the
# database superuser can access the database using some other method.
# Noninteractive access to all databases is required during automatic
# maintenance (custom daily cronjobs, replication, and similar tasks).
#
# Database administrative login by Unix domain socket
local   all             postgres                                peer

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
# THIS IS THE LINE YOU WANT TO CHANGE TO BE THE FOLLOWING:
local   all             all                                     md5
```

Then restart the service: `service postgresql restart`.

Now you can test the connection:

```bash
root@hostname:~# psql -U name_of_user -d name_of_database
Password for user name_of_user:
```

### Configuration

You can view the important directories from the configuraton file:

```
/etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf
```

The database data directory by default is:

```
/var/lib/postgresql/14/main
```

Further, you should update the password mode from `md5` to `scram-sha-256`.

```
password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256'
```

Set in `postgresql.conf`. If you have set any passwords, you will need to reset
them.

### External Ports

If you want Postgres to listen on the open Internet, you can change the
`listen_address = *` in `postgresql.conf`. While generally not a good idea if
you can avoid it, a strong passwords and TLS connections will be secure.

Also keep the database up to date.

### Connecting via SSL

Postgres has SSL enabled by default. To connect with it, add the following
parameter to your connection string:

```
?sslmode=require
```

Congratulations! You have set up PostgreSQL on your Ubuntu system, created a
user and database for your application, and can connect to it. So, wire up your
app and keep coding!
