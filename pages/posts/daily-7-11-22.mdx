Often I find myself thinking of the best version of a thing. This _thing_ doesn't
need to be a product. It could be an event, a house project, or where I want my
life to go.

I think of how far away I am from that thing and how the initial version of it
(currently, whatever that is) sucks compared to that vision.

But I need to remind myself that not everyone else _sees_ that far-off thing.
That vision is only in my head. So the initial version is honestly not that bad.
It's probably fine. And fine is shippable. Fine is worth doing. Doing something
"fine" now will grant you the experience to _get_ to that far off vision.

So get off your butt and just do it.
