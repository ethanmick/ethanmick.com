I like to do things. So, I'm trying to be more deliberate with my time and use
that time wisely to get things done that [I care
about]((https://ethanmick.com/posts/daily-7-13-22). One of the unexpected
consequences of this is that I try to spend more time doing things than simply
talking about them.

Elon Musk told Gwynne Shotwell when she first joined SpaceX that he doesn't care
about making plans to do the job; just do the job (Berger 98).

That's often I feel. Don't make an excuse for why something isn't done; just get
it done. Don't make elaborate plans; start executing. Learn as you go.

Have a bias toward action.

I wonder if I go too far in that direction. What's the balance between getting
things done and sharing my experience about them? Writing and talking certainly
can have their own benefits. What am I missing out on?
