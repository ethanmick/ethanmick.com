I like to keep a tidy git repo, so every once in a while when I come to a good
stopping point I clean up my local branches. This one liner does not check the
merge status, so be careful! You can change the branch names if you have other
important branches to exclude.

```bash
git branch | egrep -v "(^\*|master|main|dev)" | xargs git branch -D # cleanup git branches
```

That's all!

  The `#` at the end is a bash comment. It allows you to search for this command
  in your history using keywords!
