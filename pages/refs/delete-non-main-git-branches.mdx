I like to keep a tidy git repo, so every once in a while when I come to a good
stopping point I clean up my local branches. This doesn't check if the branch
has been merged into `main` or not, so be careful you don't have any work lying
around in them.

```bash
git branch | egrep -v "(^\*|master|main|dev)" | xargs git branch -D # cleanup git branches
```
