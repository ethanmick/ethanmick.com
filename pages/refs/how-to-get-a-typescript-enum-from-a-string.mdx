Enums in TypeScript are very helpful for defining a set of values. To turn a
string into an enum, you need to cast it so TypeScript understands the string
you have provided exists in the Enum.

To do this, you can do the following:

```ts
enum Animal {
  Cat,
  Dog,
  Mouse,
}

const name = 'Cat'
const animal: Animal = Animal[name as keyof typeof Animal]
```

This works on all modern versions of TypeScript. Here, `Name` is being cast to a
value existing within `Animal`.
