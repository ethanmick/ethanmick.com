import { Ref } from '../../components'

export const meta = {
  slug: 'unnecessary-fragment',
  title: 'Remove unnecessary fragments',
  description: 'Keep your DOM clean and simple by removing unnecessary fragments.',
  image: {
    url: 'images/remove-fragment.tsx.png',
  },
}

export default ({ children }) => <Ref {...meta}>{children}</Ref>

Keep your component structure simple by ensuring it is as flat as possible. For
example, a fragment, `<> ... </>`, is only necessary when you have more than one
child element and the function expects a single JSX element returned.

For example, a fragment is required here:

```tsx
const Component = () => (
  <>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <h2>Subtitle</h2>
  </>
)
```

But not if you return a single element:

```tsx
const Component = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <h2>Subtitle</h2>
  </div>
)
```

This is also true for functions such as `map` in a component. If you are only
returning a single element, then remove all fragments.
