Now it is time to migrate your code to use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).
You will do this by looking at how each of these components looks and migrating
the CSS that you wrote to the new Tailwind classes. While you go through and
rewrite the code, consider adding in additional classes to make your app look
fantastic with minimal effort.

Keep in mind that your design might be very different than what is written here.
Everybody has a personal flair, and Tailwind is a low-level library that allows
you to express yourself. Experiment and see what feels the best.

If you have any questions about what the classes do, you should look up the
[documentation on the Tailwind website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs). It
provides excellent examples and documentation for each of the classes.

To tackle this systematically, you can work from the **parent** DOM elements
down to the **children's** elements. That will ensure that the outer elements,
like layouts, are finished before moving on to the more detailed work.

The top-level page only has a single list, so you can dive one level deeper and
look at the list. You want it to be centered, not too wide, and have some space
at the top to keep a similar look to the previous CSS.

```tsx
<div className="mx-auto max-w-screen-sm mt-12">
  ...
</div>
```

Next, the key is to add a divider between the items for the list itself. Again,
Tailwind does this simply with `divide`:

```tsx
<ul className="divide-y">...</ul>
```

Tailwind uses `x` and `y` to differentiate horizontal and vertical directions.
You'll see this pattern across the classes. Adding some padding for vertical
spacing might look good too.

The second list of done items should have the same treatment:

```tsx
<ul className="divide-y">...</ul>
```

Next up, down a level, is updating the **add a todo input**.

```tsx
<input className="w-full rounded border text-lg leading-8" />
```

The above classes add some basic styling for the input to make it stand out.

The next component to update is the `ViewTodoListItem`:

```tsx
const ViewTodoListItem = ({
  onComplete,
  onEdit,
  text,
  done,
}: ViewTodoProps) => {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <input type="checkbox" checked={done} onChange={onComplete} />
      <span className="ml-2">{text}</span>
      <span className="flex-grow" />
      <button
        className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded hover:shadow focus:bg-gray-200"
        onClick={onEdit}
      >
        Edit
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The above code uses **flex** to line up the items straight. You want the
elements in the row centered with each other. The `span` elements gain some
spacing classes. Lastly, the button gets some simple styling to make it more
button-like. The `hover:` and `focus:` varients only apply the following class
when a user interacts with the component.

And then the edit:

```tsx
const EditTodoListItem = ({ onUpdate, ...todo }: EditTodoProps) => {
	const [text, setText] = useState(todo.text)
	const update = () => onUpdate({ ...todo, text })
	return (
		<div className="flex items-center gap-2">
			<input
				className="w-full border rounded text-lg leading-8 px-2"
				type="text"
				value={text}
				onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
			/>
			<button
				className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded hover:shadow focus:bg-gray-200"
				onClick={update}
			>
				Save
			</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

For this component, it was necessary to update the DOM a little. The outermost
layer was a Fragment, and you cannot add classes to a Fragment â€” it's not
anything that appears in the DOM. So instead, you should turn it into a div and
add your classes to it.

You can now delete the `App.css` file and the `import` into the code with these
changes.

And there you have it! Your application no longer uses the built using CSS and
now instead uses Tailwind. You can use Tailwind in any project, and it allows
you to create responsive and interactive UIs quickly. Lastly, you can stay in a
single file and write code faster using Tailwind.
