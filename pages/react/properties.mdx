In the last section, you updated your `App` component to show off a list of
hardcoded to-do items. This component now feels like it _does_ something. To
bring it to the next level, it's time to start passing data around.

You will build out two new components, a `List` and a `ListItem`. The list will
hold all of the to-dos, and the item will be responsible for displaying the
details about any single to-do. This will allow both to focus on their core
responsibilities and pass the necessary data to the children.

## Passing data down

In React you will often pass data down to components that are _within_ your
current component. These sub-components are called _children. These_ children,
in turn, may have more children. This continues until you reach a component that
has no further children. That's where the chain stops.

React uses this _component tree_ to logically pass information down. Each
component in the tree should only pass only the required information along to
the children.

For your app, the `List` will hold all the to-dos, and pass only the single item
to the `ListItem` The ListItem, for now, won't have any children, so the chain
will stop there.

### Passing data with properties

To pass data between components, React uses a syntax that works similarly to HTML.

```tsx
const ComponentA = (props: any) => {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>
}

const ComponentB = (props: any) => {
  return <ComponentA name="Ethan" />
}
```

Every component in React accepts a single parameter. This can be named anything,
but by convention, it's named `props`, which is short for _properties_.

`props` value is a plain old JavaScript object. In TypeScript it can be given a
type. This object has all the key-value pairs that are passed to it.

Every time you pass a parameter you use the `key=value` syntax. This is true for
native HTML elements like `<input type="text" />` or custom components like
above.

This works a lot better than having multiple function parameters. HTML elements
can have _a lot_ of different parameters and many of them are optional. Imagine
if you had to list them out:

```tsx
function img(src, alt, title, style, className, height, width, ...) {}
```

This breaks down for custom components since you could pass _any_ number of
parameters. Instead of listing things out, React passes properties in an object.

The child component (the one being called), can reference all of these key-value
pairs by looking up the `key` on the `props` object. This can be done with dot
notation, `props.key` or bracket notation, `props["key"]`.

**Properties are read-only.**

A very important core tenant of React is that the data passed into a component
is _immutable._

<Callout>
  üê¢ I wish JavaScript had better support for immutable objects! While you *can*
  change these values you should **never** do so. It will result in very weird
  bugs!
</Callout>

This includes things like strings and numbers, but also more complex data like
objects and arrays. You can make a copy of these values and change _those_, but
the actual values passed in should never be changed by your component. Props are
immutable.

### With types

Because you're coding this with TypeScript, you can effortlessly add type
checking to your components. Instead of using `any` like above, you can define
and use a type:

```tsx
type Props = {
  name: string
}

const ComponentA = (props: Props) => {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>
}

const ComponentB = (props: any) => {
  return <ComponentA name="Ethan" />
}
```

Above, `ComponentA` defines the type for its `props`. By convention, if there is
no need for a different name, the type name should be `Props`. Therefore, when
`ComponentB` calls it below, if it does not pass a `name` that is a string, you
will get a _compile-time error_. This allows you to code faster and write more
correct code. You can use TypeScript's optional types to allow for powerful and
flexible types.

### With destructuring

Lastly, when referencing the properties you want, it can be tiresome to
reference `props.key` each time. JavaScript offers an elegant solution to
_destructure_ the parameters in the function definition. The syntax is:

```tsx
({ key1, key2 }: TypeDefinition)
```

So the above example changes to:

```tsx
type Props = {
  name: string
}

const ComponentA = ({ name }: Props) => {
  return <div>{name}</div>
}
```

This takes the `props` and _destructures_ them into the named key-value pairs.
In this case, the props object will take `prop.name` and put the value into the
`name` variable in the function definition. This allows you to reference the
value you want with just the short name.

You can read more about destructuring on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

## Building real components

Now that you know how to pass data down to your components, you can build out
some smarter components for your to-do app.

The two responsible components in your app are the to-do list itself, and each
item. As these grow with complexity it will be good to have them as separate
entities.

<Callout>
  üê¢ The entire time you are working on this, you should have your dev server
  running. See the changes you are making as you make them!
</Callout>

## To-Do List

It's often easier to think from the top of the tree to the bottom. That is,
start with the big components and work your way through their children. If you
know all the components you need upfront, you can also start with the smallest
and work your way up.

<Callout>
  üê¢ I like to often start small, so each parent component can immediately use
  the child I just created.
</Callout>

To just get going, you'll start with the list itself. You can take your `App`
component and copy it as the base:

```tsx
const TodoList = () => (
  <ul>
    {todos.map((todo) => (
      <li>{todo.text}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
```

This just copies the `App` and renames it. Since you moved the logic out of
`App`, go ahead and just have `App` call your new component:

```tsx
const App = () => <TodoList />
```

Great! Although the new component though is using a globally scoped `todos`
reference. While that works, it's **not** ideal. A component can use global
_constants_, but you want this list to change eventually. That `todos` array was
just convenience, and you're beyond that now. No, instead, you should _pass_ the
to-dos into this component as a property!

Add a TypeScript definition for the props you expect. In this case, a list of
`Todos`.

```tsx
interface TodoListProps {
  todos: Todo[]
}
```

Remember, even though you are only interested in a single property, the _props
are passed as an object_. You cannot get a single property from them. Here, you
are defining the object passed should have a single key, `todos`, with a value
that is an array of `Todo`.

Add the definition to the list:

```tsx
const TodoList = ({ todos }: TodoListProps) => (...)
```

And when you do that, you should have a TypeScript compiler error! The `App`
component is not passing this new property yet. The default property object
passed to a component is an empty object, `{}` so the error looks like this:

```tsx
Property 'todos' is missing in type '{}' but required in type 'TodoListProps'. ts(2741)
```

Alright, fair enough. We declared `todos` to be required in the interface and
didn't pass it. Update the App component to pass it:

```tsx
const App = () => <TodoList todos={todos} />
```

<Callout>
  üê¢ You'll notice we're using the same name here. That's okay, JavaScript uses
  the scope to pick up and use the closest value. If this doesn't sit right with
  you, feel free to rename some variables.
</Callout>

With all this moving around of code, your app should look blissfully the same.

## Adding the `TodoListItem`

The `TodoList` above doesn't use a custom component, it just creates an `li`
HTML element. You have big plans for this app, so a custom component is
necessary. It's time to create the `TodoListItem`. This item will be responsible
for displaying the `<li>` and the text. What data is going to be passed to this?
Just the `text` of a Todo. The good news is you already have an interface that
defines that exact thing, the `Todo` interface itself!

You can reuse that and create:

```tsx
const TodoListItem = ({ text }: Todo) => <li>{text}</li>
```

This single line component takes in `text` and displays it in an `li`. You
aren't calling it yet though, so return to your `TodoList` component and update
it.

Instead of:

```tsx
<ul>
  {todos.map((todo) => (
    <li>{todo.text}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

Replace it with:

```tsx
<ul>
  {todos.map(({ text }, index) => (
    <TodoListItem key={index} text={text} />
  ))}
</ul>
```

Boom! This destructures the `todo` in the `map` function call since there is
just a single key to work with. It also pulls in the `index` param to use as the
`key` below. It calls the new `TodoListItem` component and passes `key` and
`text` to the item.

So uh, what the heck is `key`.

## Special props, `key`, and `children`.

React has two magical properties. The first is `key`. The official docs explain
it well:

> Keys help React identify which items [in a list] have changed, are added, or
> are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the
> elements a stable identity.
>
> The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list
> item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys.
> When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as
> a key as a last resort:

<Callout>
  üê¢ Using indexes as keys have problems, as explained
  [here](https://robinpokorny.medium.com/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318)
  and
  [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children).
</Callout>

When creating any elements from a list you must give those elements a unique
`key.`

Here, you don't have anything other than the index to use. Any to-do may have
the same text as another to-do. Since they are not unique, the index will have
to do for now.

### Children

The other special property is `children`. This is used to access _children_
elements that are passed to a component. For example, imagine a component whose
responsibility is to be a card.

```tsx
const Card => ({ children }) => (
  <div className="box-shadow rounded-corners background-white">
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

This component wants to take _any_ content and wrap it in a card like diagram.
It doesn't accept those children as regular props, the children _are the
elements inside the card_. Called like this:

```tsx
<Card>
  <div>
    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>lots of text</p>
  </div>
</Card>
```

To refer to the `div` and elements passed _into_ the card, the special name
`children` is used. The `Card` component then just ‚Äúpasses through‚Äù the children
and renders them using `{children}`.

This does bring up an interesting point of ‚Äúwhat's correct?‚Äù Both of these are
indentical:

```tsx
// Option A
const TodoListItem = ({ text }: Todo) => <li>{text}</li>

// Option B
const TodoListItem = ({ children }: Todo) => <li>{children}</li>
```

However they are called differently:

```tsx
// Option A
<TodoListItem text={text} />

// Optionn B
<TodoListItem>{text}</TodoListItem>
```

Which is correct? It mostly depends on the situation and the contents of _text_.
If `text` ends up being a lot of DOM and other components, it's acting more like
part of the DOM tree than just a string. If `text` is a simple string, then
passing it as a property named `text` is simple.

## Wrapping up

You have refactored your to-do application to use more components. These
components are separated by responsibility. They don't do a ton yet, but there
is room for growth. Importantly these components can be reused and they separate
concerns.

You can now pass data down through your application. This lets you pass the
to-dos down to the list item, which displays the information.

Of course, it's still a static list. You can't change anything. While properties
are read-only and immutable, _state_ is not. And to change up your list, you
will need to remove the constant `todos` and step into the world of managing
state, something that changes:

```tsx
const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>([])
```

This will turn your demo into a fully functioning app. Ready to learn how?
