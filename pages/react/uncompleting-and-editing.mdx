[In the last section](https://ethanmick-git-ethanmick-react-06-ethanmick.vercel.app/react/completing-todos), you learned how to check items off your to-do list. When
going over the requirements, there was an option:

> As a user, I want to mark un-complete items that are incomplete.

The above requirement changed the scope considerably. Before that requirement,
you could delete a completed item from the list. However, once a user wants to
see historical items, edit them, or mark them as incomplete, you need to track
them forever.

But, of course, that's the better thing to do. That will make your product
better, even if it's more work. Creating a product isn't always easy. So let's
jump in and get into the nitty-gritty!

## Un-completing items

This turns out to be pretty straightforward. There are two things you will need
to do to get this working. The first is to show the user those completed items.
The second is to reverse the "complete" function to mark them as done.

Showing the items is easy. Duplicate the code for displaying the items, but
instead of filtering out the things that are not _done_, filter out the ones
that _are_ done. It looks like this.

```tsx
<ul>
  {
    todos
      .filter(({ done }) => done)
      .map((todo) => (
        <TodoListItem key={todo.id} onComplete={onComplete} {...todo} />
      ))
  }
</ul>
```

The function `onComplete` still works here because of a tricky line of code you
entered earlier: `done: !todos[i].done`. That line doesn't set `done` to false
at all times. Instead, it flips the bit from true to false or vice versa. That
allows you to call the same function and have it change the to-do from done to
not done.

Great job! You can now mark items as not complete. To add more distinction
between the two lists, you can add a header to mark the items that have been
finished:

```tsx
<h2>Complete</h2>
```

Put that right before your second ul to note the items below have been
completed.

## All Complete!

Congrats! Now your users can mark items not complete if they accidentally tap
the button. They can correct their mistakes which is always an important
function. The user can fix their errors.

Right?

_All_ their mistakes...

Hmm, what if they mistyped a to-do in the first place? Do the users want to
_edit_ a to-do?

Just have them complete it and enter it again!

No? They didn't like that response?

Fine.

Time to add editing.

## Editing a to-do

Alright, well, this starts getting tricky. Editing a to-do changes the
interaction paradigm a user has with their to-dos. There are also multiple ways
to do this, so feel free to diverge a little and tackle it another way.

A user will most likely want to view and complete a to-do. Editing is a less
common interaction, and it should not be the primary mode of interaction. You
might want to make every to-do list item just an input field so the user can
always edit it, but that's not the best idea. If you do that, the user will
accidentally trigger editing items when they don't want to.

Instead, a better option is to break up the modes. One mode for viewing and
completing (the primary way) and then a button flips the user into _edit_ mode,
where all they can do is edit the to-do.

With this approach, you can break the code into two distinct modes, viewing and
editing. Then, the components can match the mode with an "Edit this to-do list
item" and "view this to-do list item" component. The list itself doesn't need to
know what mode any individual row is in; it just needs to know when one of them
changes.

Let's work from what you have and move down. Update the component `TodoListItem`
so that it tracks the _mode._ It is either in edit mode or not, and the user can
change that. It sounds like a new state! Add it:

```tsx
const [isEditMode, setEditMode] = useState(false)
```

The user will not start in edit mode, which is most common. So what happens with
that state? The user toggles the state, and the app shows different
functionality based on the view.

That's a lot to fit into a single component, and those are two different
behaviors. When you come to points like this... make more components! Create two
new components, one for each mode:

```tsx
const ViewTodoListItem = () => null

const EditTodoListItem = () => null
```

You'll fill out the contents of those later. But you can now finish the stub of
`TodoListItem` by calling those:

```tsx
return (
  <li>
    {isEditMode ? (
      <EditTodoListItem {...todo} />
    ) : (
      <ViewTodoListItem {...todo} />
    )}
  </li>
)
```

If `isEditMode` is true, return the edit mode. Otherwise, return the view mode.
Now, `TodoListItem` _used_ to be view-only mode, so you mostly have that done. So
jump there and finish up that component.

## View mode of a list item

Copying the [old
code](https://github.com/ethanmick/react-05/blob/main/src/App.tsx#L34-L43) from
`TodoListItem` gives you a component that looks like this.

```tsx
type TodoListItemProps = {
  onChange: () => void
} & Todo

const ViewTodoListItem = ({ text, done, onChange }: TodoListItemProps) => (
  <li>
    <input type="checkbox" checked={done} onChange={(e) => onChange()} />
    <span>{text}</span>
  </li>
)
```

After adding that, change the props to be named `ViewTodoProps`. You'll come back
to `onChange`; it can just stay there for now. The last thing is a new addition.

The list item will show this component when _not_ in edit mode. How does the
user _enter_ edit mode? A user interaction will change the state. To make it
easy and obvious, you'll add a button.

```tsx
<button>Edit</button>
```

Toss that button after the `span` element. Then, when the user clicks it, you need
to trigger a callback to tell the parent to update its mode.

```tsx
type ViewTodoProps = {
  onComplete: () => void
  onEdit: () => void // Add this line
} & Todo

// Lower, update this line
<button onClick={onEdit}>Edit</button>
```

Back in TodoListItem, it needs to pass in the callback that will change the
mode.

```tsx
<ViewTodoListItem
  onEdit={() => setEditMode((e) => !e)}
  {...todo}
/>
```

The above code uses the function setter to set `isEditMode` according to the
previous value. When you press the edit button, it will hide the
`ViewTodoListItem` and show... nothing! Time to work on editing.

## Edit mode of a list item

The edit mode is simple, a text box with a button to save. Very similar to
adding an item. You also need to _handle_ passing that data back up to the list
so it can set the state of the to-do. Just like marking an item as complete goes
up, so needs changing the text of an item.

Editing a to-do will look like this:

```tsx
type EditTodoProps = {} & Todo

const EditTodoListItem = ({ ...todo }: EditTodoProps) => {
  const [text, setText] = useState(todo.text)
  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button>Save</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

There should not be anything too surprising about this. The most interesting
line is the `useState` line. Instead of setting the default state to `''`, which
you've done before, you set it to the _text of the to-do item_. This means the
text field will start with that text instead of being blank. When the input
changes, you update the state. Lastly, a save button that does nothing yet.

When the user clicks save, it needs to call a function letting the parent know
the user wants to save _this_ to-do. The parent is no longer the list; it is the
`TodoListItem`. So _that_ component needs to call a callback to let the `TodoList`
itself know something changed.

Phew.

Luckily, you can structure our code so passing these through is pretty painless.
You do that by structuring the functions to have the same function signature.

Working backward, when a user clicks "save" to save an edited to-do, you need to
call a function saying that to-do had the text changed, and here is the new
text. This could be done by just passing the text to a function, but if you pass
the entire `Todo` object, it will make things a lot easier. You'll see why in a
moment.

So, add a new callback for saving:

```tsx
type EditTodoProps = {
  onUpdate: (todo: Todo) => void // Added
} & Todo

const EditTodoListItem = ({ onUpdate, ...todo }: EditTodoProps) => {
  const [text, setText] = useState(todo.text)

  // This line is new
  const update = () => onUpdate({ ...todo, text })

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
      />

      /* This line is updated */
      <button onClick={update}>Save</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

The onUpdate function requires the entire `Todo` passed in. You call that with
`update` in your component that passes _back_ the `Todo` passed to you with the
updated text. Now you need to update the parent `TodoListItem`.

```tsx
type TodoListItemProps = {
  onEdit: (todo: Todo) => void
} & Todo

// Below, in the JSX update this line
<EditTodoListItem onUpdate={onEdit} {...todo} />
```

You add a new property, `onEdit,` which will tell the `TodoList` when a to-do
has been edited. Then you pass that function to `EditTodoListItem`.

Because the function signature is the same, you don't need to invoke it with:

```tsx
onUpdate={(todo) => onEdit(todo)}
```

The above is redundant and not necessary. You can just pass it through because
the function is called with the same parameters. Easy!

Now backing up once again to the `TodoList` you can write onEdit.

```tsx
const onEdit = (todo: Todo) => {
  setTodos((todos) => {
  const i = todos.findIndex(({ id }) => todo.id === id)
  todos[i] = todo
  return [...todos]
})
}
```

The above code is a little simpler than `onComplete` because instead of changing
the `Todo` to flip the done value, you just trust that the to-do passed in is the
one that should be set. Then, the code looks up that index and overrides the
entire to-do.

Since you're overriding the `Todo`, this means the done value is also set.

It means that this function can do the same thing as `onComplete` but easier. So
you can actually _remove_ `onComplete` and update that functionality.

```tsx
<ViewTodoListItem
  onComplete={() => onEdit({ ...todo, done: !todo.done })}
  onEdit={() => setEditMode((e) => !e)}
  {...todo}
/>
```

Instead of calling a unique `onComplete` method now, when the user taps
`onComplete`, set the value of done to be the opposite of what was there before.
Then call `onEdit`, which is your function above, setting the `Todo`. The same
function handles both completing a to-do and editing one!

And now the user can do both of those actions! Once a user enters edit mode,
you'll notice that they don't get out when they click save. You can update the
`TodoListItem` code to kick them out when they save:

```tsx
const onUpdate = (todo: Todo) => {
  setEditMode(false)
  onEdit(todo)
}

// Later
<EditTodoListItem onUpdate={onUpdate} {...todo} />
```

## Finishing with style

The app is getting to the point where manually editing CSS is a pain. It's in a
different file, and the DOM doesn't have classes or IDs. While you can add
those, there are better ways to handle CSS in React. For example, instead of
adding CSS in a file, a shortcut is to add _inline_ CSS right in the JSX.

To start, that `<h2>Complete</h2>` you added earlier can be a little nicer.

```tsx
<h2 style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: 14 }}>Complete</h2>
```

React inline styles are an object, not a string. The CSS properties are
camel-cased, and some can be numbers instead of strings where it makes sense.
Above, the `font-size` is 14 pixels.

Since you already have some CSS for the following, go and open `App.css` and
update:

```css
ul li div {
  padding: 0.5rem;
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start;
}

ul li span {
  margin-left: 0.5rem;
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

And your app will look nicer. Not great, but nicer. It's about time to really up
the ante in making an app.
