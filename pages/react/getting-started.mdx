Alright, it's time to code React! This is best done by following along, asking
questions, and writing code. Please feel free to [reach
out](mailto:ethan@ethanmick.com) to me with any questions you have.

This section will get the project created and walk through what each of the
files is and does. I'll trim down the boilerplate code to something simple so
each line of code is understandable. You will know exactly what every line of
code in your project does.

Let's dive in!

## Install Node

The first requirement is to have a modern version of
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime
that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer. The code you write is
not the same code that the browser executes. React adds some magic that web
browsers cannot understand. Instead, the code is compiled to JavaScript which
can be _interpreted_ by the browser. This is common for advanced web apps.

Fire up your terminal.

### macOS

I suggest you use [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/):

```jsx
brew install node
```

### Windows

Install from the website, and then open Powershell to verify.

[https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Ubuntu

```tsx
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
```

### Post Install

After you install Node.js, you can then run:

```jsx
node --version
```

And have something after `14.x` be the result. `16.x`. is the latest LTS
version.

## Setting up the app

Learning React is best done by building a web app to exercise the concepts you
are learning. Academic learning doesn't build muscle memory like writing code
does.

I encourage you to make something _else_ as well to exercise the things you have
learned. You'll find new problems and issues that aren't covered here. Those are
great questions to come ask!

This guide is going to start basic and layer in more complex topics. I want to
guide you in building something, but also understanding what you are making.

The app you are making will follow the same pattern, starting basic and growing
in complexity.

To that end, this guide is going to focus on making a **to-do app.**

### Running the commands

Now that Node.js is installed, it's time to set up your first React app. This is
best done with `create-react-app`. This command will create the basic structure
of your project and set up the build system. `create-react-app` has different
templates and this guide will use the `typescript` one. Again, TypeScript is
awesome.

This setup is not just for basic quick apps. It is meant to take you to a
production website. If you ever outgrow the scaffolding in `create-react-app`
you can run a command to get access to all the underlying configurations
(`eject`).

To start, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app todo-app --template typescript
```

<AsciinemaPlayer src="https://asciinema.org/a/RqTgJpSFR4FAHjZvVdU63Vqse.cast" />

### Let's unpack that a little

This jumpstarts your entire project! There is a lot of code to explore,
especially if this is your first React app.

```tsx
cd todo-app
```

Let's check out what this has made!

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── logo192.png
│   ├── logo512.png
│   ├── manifest.json
│   └── robots.txt
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.test.tsx
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.tsx
│   ├── logo.svg
│   ├── react-app-env.d.ts
│   ├── reportWebVitals.ts
│   └── setupTests.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

I'll dive in deeper in a bit, but the basic file structure is:

- `public` serves all files in it _as is_, outside of the React runtime.
- `src` is for all files that are compiled into your final React app.
- `tsconfig.json` is the TypeScript configuration.
- `yarn.lock` or `package.lock` is the lock file for your dependencies.

## Start it up!

Let's make sure it works before you go on and break everything:

```jsx
npm start
```

This will start the development server, compile the react app, and open a tab in
your preferred browser on port `3000`. You should see your app up and running!
Congrats!

<Browser
  url="localhost:3000"
  src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-cdn.ethanmick.com/react/getting-started/initial-run/index.html"
  title="Initial React App"
/>

This comes with live reloading, so you can go into a file, change it, and see
the changes.

<Callout>
  🐢 Software Engineering is about making changes and validating them as quickly as possible. If
  you're spending your time _waiting_ for something, ask yourself, "is there a faster way?"
</Callout>

## Demystifying the magic

Create-React-App is an incredible tool to get you started quickly. It brings a
certain level of magic though. The downside to this is if you don't set
everything up from scratch, then it's harder to understand what is going on
under the covers. When things break, it's harder to debug. The benefit is you
have an app up and running in one command.

I'm a big fan of understanding what's going on _as much as is reasonable_. You
don't need to create a build system, but understanding what's happening in this
one will help a lot.

Let's go!

### The files

There are four files on the top level that are all important.

### `package-lock.json`

Or `yarn.lock`. This keeps the dependencies from changing between installs.

### `package.json`

This defines the dependencies in the project. These are all, incorrectly, listed
in the `dependencies` key. Most of them should be in `devDependencies` instead.

You can safely change them to this (version numbers might be slightly
different):

<CodeFile language="json" file="package.json">
  {`"dependencies": {
  "react": "17.0.2",
  "react-dom": "17.0.2",
  "react-scripts": "5.0.0",
  "web-vitals": "2.1.4"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "5.16.2",
  "@testing-library/react": "12.1.2",
  "@testing-library/user-event": "13.5.0",
  "@types/jest": "27.4.0",
  "@types/node": "16.11.22",
  "@types/react": "17.0.39",
  "@types/react-dom": "17.0.11",
  "typescript": "4.5.5"
}`}
</CodeFile>

If you changed it, run:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

Both the commands `npm start` and `npm build` will continue to work as expected.
Why does this matter? As the number of dependencies increases, it's important to
keep them separate. This will help you and your team to organize your project.
It can be used at different stages of CI to only install certain dependencies.

You should also remove the `^` in front of the version numbers. This symbol
[informs the package
manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#dependencies)
which versions of the dependency are okay to install. The `^` means anything
that is “compatible” with this version. What does compatible mean? It's pretty
ambiguous. At the end of the day, it's safer to pin your dependencies to an
exact version. That's what just having the version number does.

As for the dependencies, React requires `react` and `react-dom`. The project
scaffolding requires `react-scripts`, which run the scripts listed in the
`package.json` file.

For the dev dependencies, they are either testing dependencies or used by
TypeScript.

<Callout>🐢 Fun Fact: React and React DOM used to be the same library!</Callout>

### `README.md`

The project readme, which offers good instructions. Feel free to replace the
content with details about your process and app.

### `tsconfig.json`

This is the configuration file for TypeScript. You can read about the various
options here:
[https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig).
For now, the defaults will suffice.

The most important thing to note is that this configuration only looks at the
files in `src` directory. You can't put files outside of that directory and have
them work.

## Moving into the directories

Next up are the directories and their contents.

### `/public`

- `favicon.ico` is the favicon.
- `logo192.png` and `logo512.png` are static images used in the app.
- `manifest.json` is for a progressive web app and can change attributes when a
  shortcut is installed on a device. You can read more
  [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
- `robots.txt` is for bots to scrape or not scrape the website.

There is one file I want to dive into:

### `index.html`

This is mostly normal markup, but there are two things you should note. If this
is your first look at HTML, (**[HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)**), it is the
language of defining content on the web. The first thing to note is:

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" />
```

This uses a special string, `%PUBLIC_URL%`, that is swapped out at build time
the path to the `public` path on the server. Most of the time, this is `/`, the
root path. If you host your web app on a different path it can be updated to use
that.

This file sets lots of sane defaults, but most of it is also _completely
unnecessary_. I think it's important to understand what's **required** here. And
what's _technically_ required, to have the app work... is a single line of code.
Please delete the entire file and replace it with:

```tsx
<div id="root" />
```

(For the sharp eyes, this is on line 31 of the file).

<Callout>
  🐢 The **div** part of this isn't important. React looks **any** tag up with that id. And the
  specific tag isn't important either.
</Callout>

Save the file. Stop and restart the development server.

```bash
ctrl-c

npm start
```

It should look exactly the same. If you want to add back some of the code you
removed you can do so. If you don't know what any of it means, you can look it
up as you add it back! A basic `index.html` with the important parts looks like:

<CodeFile language="html" file="index.html">
  {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>To Do App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
`}
</CodeFile>

### `src`

This is React! All the files ending in `tsx` are React files. Before jumping
into those, take a look at the other files.

### `App.test.tsx`

This file contains the tests for the `App.tsx` file. This uses the fantastic
[`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
library to test React.

<CodeFile language="tsx" file="App.test.tsx">
  {`
test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />)
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i)
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument()
})
  `}
</CodeFile>

How this works is:

1. [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) runs the test, which is defined by `test()`.
2. The `render` call will render the component like a browser will but without the browser!
3. Then, ask the `screen` object (which has the rendered result), to get the element with the text.
4. Run a test assertion, expecting the element to be in the document.

You can do more intricate things with tests, but I'll get to that in a later
chapter. Tests are critical for creating a production-quality app, and React
testing is some of the best.

### `setupTests.ts`

This file sets up the tests for Jest.

### `reportWebVitals.ts`

This file sets up reporting web vitals. You can read more about web vitals
[here](https://web.dev/vitals/).

### `react-app-env.d.ts`

This file is needed for the scripts to run. It has the type definitions for the
types.

### `App.tsx`

Ah yes, React. This file contains the React code you are going to work with.
You're going to build this up, but first, you need to remove the generic
starting template. This will get down to basics and make sure you understand
everything you are writing.

Clear out the file for the following:

<CodeFile language="tsx" file="App.tsx">
  {`
function App() {
  return <span>Hello World</span>
}\n
export default App
`}
</CodeFile>

- `function` defines a JavaScript function, with the name `App`.
- This function takes no parameters, so `()` is the function signature. It then
  has the contents of the function inside the `{ }` brackets.
- It `return`s the expression, so the caller can use it.
- That expression is a JSX element, which you will see in more detail in the
  next chapter. That element is later rendered by the browser and it shows up!
- Lastly, mark this as `export` so the expression exported can be used in
  another file.
- It's a `default` export, which means it is imported with the syntax:
  `import NameHere from './file'`.

<Callout>
  🐢 You no longer need to `import React from 'react'` in your files with React 17 or higher.
  [Details here.](https://github.com/ethanmick/ethanmick.com/pull/66/files)
</Callout>

And that's the file! You can trim it down some more with ES 6 syntax:

<CodeFile language="tsx" file="App.tsx">
  {`
export default () => <span>Hello World</span>
`}
</CodeFile>

This is as small and simple as it can get. It exports a default function that
has **no** name. That function is a component, and it returns the JSX element of
`<span>Hello World</span>`.

A React component needs to return JSX element, it can't return just a regular
string. This is why you can't return the literal `'Hello World`. You need to
wrap it with the a tag, `span` in this instance.

When you trim this down, it will look like this:

<Browser
  url="localhost:3000"
  src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/code-cdn.ethanmick.com/react/getting-started/final/index.html"
  title="Final React App"
/>

(Not very exciting yet. But simple!)

<Callout>
  🐢 Your linter may not like that single line. I know. It **isn't** good code. But it's short and
  simple, and you can explain every character. You will build it back up and understand the steps
  along the way.
</Callout>

Moving on.

### `index.tsx`

This file contains the root of your application. It is what starts React.

<CodeFile language="tsx" file="index.tsx">
  {`
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
`}
</CodeFile>

It is the entry point, where React renders your application inside a Strict Mode
boundary. Strict mode is a development aid and doesn't render anything in the
browser. You can read more on the [official
docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html).

By removing the unnecessary code, you can trim this down to:

<CodeFile language="tsx" file="index.tsx">
  {`
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import App from './App'\n
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))
`}
</CodeFile>

This is the only code _needed_, including imports. Remember the `index.html`
edited earlier? It was trimmed down entirely to just have `id="root"` . The
`root` word wasn't important. It can be any word. This JavaScript code executes
and finds the specified browser DOM element. It uses that element as the _root_
of the React app. Almost all the time, you want it to be at the root of your
project.

### Purge if you want

At this point, you can delete a lot of these files and slim down the project. If
this helps focus you and remove clutter, you can remove:

- `App.css`
- `App.test.tsx`
- `index.css`
- `logo.svg`
- `reportWebVitals.ts`
- `setupTests.ts`

The `index.tsx` and `App.tsx` files should be updated to _not_ import the above
files if you delete them.

## Into the DOM

Lastly, let's do some inspection of what the browser sees. To properly do this,
you will need to install the React Dev tools:

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

Once installed the dev tools give you the ability to see exactly what your
browser is rendering at the React level, which is very powerful. To open the dev
tools right-click anywhere on the webpage and click “**Inspect**”.

The elements/inspector tab should look like:

![Dev tools inspector](/images/react/getting-started-dev-tools.png)

You know where every single element came from! The `<html>` and `<body>` are
defined in our `index.html` file. Even if you remove them, the browser will
ensure they are present. The `<div id="root">` is also in the HTML file, that's
the root of our React App. Everything inside that div is React, and it says...
“Hello World”. That's the super simple `App` component we created earlier.

To get started with the React developer tools switch to the "⚛️ Components" or
"⚛️ Profiler" tab. You may need to restart the browser if you just installed
them.

Jump to the _Components_ tab.

![React dev tools](/images/react/getting-started-react-dev-tools.png)

If you don't see anything here, go back to your `index.tsx` file. Add back in
the `<React.StrictMode>`, around the `<App />`. StrictMode helps with debugging!

Remember above how I said the no-named export above is **not** good code? This
is why. Because it does not have a name, _no name shows up in the React Dev
tools_. This makes debugging harder. When Debugging is harder then programming
takes longer.

Go back to `App.tsx` and change the content to:

<CodeFile language="tsx" file="App.tsx">
  {`
const App = () => <span>Hello World</span>
export default App
`}
</CodeFile>

Now the React dev tools should show:

![React dev tools with good name](/images/react/getting-started-react-dev-tools-app.png)

Your component has a name! Much nicer.

React only sees the `App`, because that is the only component it is rendering.
Remember, React doesn't see the `html`, `body`, and `div` tags in the
`index.html` since they are _outside_ the root. All React knows about is the one
component it's rendering. That will turn into a lot more soon.

### The React programmer lifecycle

To get from the code to what the browser renders, you:

1. Write your code in TypeScript
2. It gets compiled into JavaScript. If there are errors you can catch them
   here!
3. React loads and executes that JavaScript. React does powerful things _before_
   the browser sees the final output.
4. React then passes the final output to the browser, which renders and displays
   it.

React renders only when it needs to, which can be once, or many times per
second.

And now you're writing in React.

## Optionally, set up Prettier

Install Prettier for your editor: [https://prettier.io/](https://prettier.io/)

Code consistency is important. It helps with code merges. It keeps you focused
on writing code, and not paying attention to what the code looks like. You can
tweak the settings to your preferred style, but I stay pretty close to the
defaults.

Except for semicolons. Those can go.

```tsx
npm install --save prettier
```

My `.prettierrc.json` file:

<CodeFile language="json" file=".prettierrc.json">
  {`
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "semi": false
}
`}
</CodeFile>

## From code to DOM

You are now at the point where you can start hacking on your React project! You
can write your code in the `src` folder. You know what each file is and what
every line of code does. With hot reloading, you can edit the code, save it, and
it will show up in the browser instantly. Lastly, you can inspect the browser
DOM to see exactly what the browser sees. You can also use the React Developer
tools to see what _React_ sees. This is often the layer you will be debugging.

Where to now? More code! Let's build a fantastic To-Do app!
