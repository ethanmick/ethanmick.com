In the last section, you started your project with `create-react-app` and then
slimmed it down to the basics. You should understand what each file does. React
isn't magic.

In this section, it's time to start building up from that foundation. The most
basic of sites, Hello World, will become a powerful to-do app. To do that, you
need to start making new components.

Components are the main building block of React.

A **component** is a `function` which returns **JSX**.

That's it! The scope of components can be big or small. There is a good middle
ground where components contain some logic and markup.

Your entire project will be built around these components.

Let's get started!

## So, what is JSX

JSX stands for JavaScript (JS) Extension (X). It's an extension to the language
itself and adds the ability to write **markup** in JavaScript files.

Because JSX is an extension, a browser cannot execute it directly. You cannot
run a `.jsx` file in the browser. All `.jsx` files need to be compiled down to
regular JavaScript for the browser. This is why starting a React project is not
as simple as writing some HTML and JavaScript. You need to introduce a _build_
step.

The build step is also the reason why writing React with TypeScript is
beneficial. TypeScript also needs to compile down to JavaScript. Because React
_already_ requires a build step, writing in TypeScript doesn't introduce an
unnecessary step. The step is already required.

When writing TypeScript JSX, the file extension is `.tsx`. Some project setups
will complain if you write JSX in a regular `.ts` file. Make sure the file
extension is correct if you have issues.

It's useful to think of JSX as being much closer to JavaScript with some markup
as opposed to HTML with JavaScript. Done correctly, the file is mostly
JavaScript with markup sprinkled in.

JSX couples together the user interface with the _logic_ that goes with it.

This coupling may be considered bad. It may be foreign if you've heard of
model-view-controller. React takes the stance that it's a natural part of
building user interfaces. You can disagree, but that's how it works.

Therefore, if React couples together the view and logic, how do you separate
things? What are the boundaries?

React promotes _logical_ separation. You separate things apart by concern and
responsibility. What a chunk of code _does._ Logical pieces of the user
interface will form the components.

<Callout>
  üê¢ Other frameworks (looking at you, Angular), separate things by technology
  as well.
</Callout>

### TypeScript and JSX

TypeScript goes a good job of showing how the JSX runtime looks in code. When
working in JSX files you can explore the TypeScript definitions:

```ts
declare global { // Declaring this as globally available
  namespace JSX { // JSX!
	  interface Element // Defining an interface, React will implement this
      interface IntrinsicElements { // Redefines HTML, in JSX
        // HTML
        a: React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>, HTMLAnchorElement>;
        div: React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, HTMLDivElement>;
        p: React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>, HTMLParagraphElement>;
        /// All the rest of the HTML elements
      }
   }
}
```

TypeScript defines the JSX namespace. JSX is a generic standard, and different
runtimes can implement it in different ways. React is one such runtime. JSX
defines the syntax but it is not specific to React.

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/), for example, has the ability to to support JSX
expressions:

```tsx
const vnode = <div>hello</div>
```

Valid Vue code! There are some differences between how Vue works and React, but
that's the power of the JSX runtime. It allows libraries to implement the
extension as they want, with differences.

### Quirks

The React runtime implements JSX with a few quirks of JavaScript coming through.
Not all, but some.

The first is that there are some keywords you can't use in your markup, the
biggest two being `class` and `for`.

```tsx
const node = <p class="text-large">My text.</p>
```

The above code is not valid React JSX. `class` here is treated as the _keyword_
class*.* And as such, you need to use `className` instead: For those who write a
lot of HTML, that might be a bummer.

```tsx
const node = <p className="text-large">My text.</p>
```

Your IDE autocomplete should autocomplete `className` over `class` to make your
life easy.

Same for the HTML `for`, as in:

```tsx
<div>
  <label for="cheese">Do you like cheese?</label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="cheese" id="cheese">
</div>
```

Here, `for` here is the keyword, like a `for loop`. You need to use:

```tsx
<label htmlFor="cheese">Do you like cheese?</label>
```

These are some of the quirks that shine through in React's JSX. Not all
libraries implement JSX in the same way. When switching projects you might see
some differences.

### JSX - Write HTML in JavaScript

That's what JSX is. An extension to _JavaScript_ that different libraries can
implement. It allows the syntax of HTML and JavaScript to be written together.
React implements the JSX interface. At runtime, these elements are turned into
DOM and rendered by the browser.

<Callout>
  üê¢ Do you need to write React with JSX? The answer is no, you don't need to.
  But you should. See here:{' '}
  <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html">
    https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
  </a>
</Callout>

Anyways, back to _fun_ React.

### Write in JSX; think in Components

A component is a function that returns JSX. That's it! That JSX can be your
entire application, or as small as a single fragment that contains no rendered
DOM.

In general, it's good to organize your application around components that make
sense. Since each component is just a function, they are very easy to create and
use. Components make sense for shared pieces of functionality. They can also be
used to structure your code better. At the end of the day, it's up to you (and
your team) on where it makes the most sense to draw these boundaries.

<Callout>
  üßë‚Äçüíª I will make suggestions on component structure and where to break things
  apart. Feel free to change things around though!
</Callout>

## Building components

More components are good.

**Components are very lightweight.**

The more the merrier! This might be different from your experience in other
frameworks. In other frameworks, a new component creates several files and links
modules together. This friction results in components being **larger**, since
creating any single new component is more **effort**.

In React, components don't need to be in different files. Many times that should
not be the case. A component should be as _visible_ as it needs to be. If a
component is a helper and only used in one place, keep all that logic in the
same file.

Components don't need to be shared. Breaking apart the code into components can
be done to make it easier to maintain and read.

Keep in mind that moving your components around is also trivially easy. Since
it's just a function, just move the component to a new file and update any
imports. Most editors will do this refactoring for you.

Be careful not to abstract things too far though; there's a balance. Components
that don't have any responsibility themselves aren't helpful.

Alright, it's time to start building out the basics of your **to-do**
application. The focus will be the component structure, followed by some design
cleanup.

## Adding some to-dos

You're going to create some new components which capture the logical sections of
the app. You got this!

The simplest to-do app can:

- Add a to-do
- View the to-dos
- Mark a to-do as completed

To start, this will focus on _viewing_ the to-dos.

### The list of to-dos

It's easy to start here because you can mock the data. Mocking allows you to
focus on building the correct components. A later section will build adding your
own to-dos.

To start, define the structure of the data. If a ‚Äúto-do list‚Äù is a list of
to-dos... what is a **to-do?** What information needs to be saved? The most
basic is the `text` of the to-do. You can add other properties if you'd like. I
like to start simple.

Because you are using TypeScript, you can create an `interface` for this
structure of data. TypeScript uses this to ensure the objects that are passed
around have the required data.

Near the top of your `App.tsx` file:

```tsx
interface Todo {
  text: string
}
```

Here, we define a `Todo` as an **object** with one key, `text` that is type
`string`. In JavaScript, an object that _implements_ this interface would
be:

```js
{
  text: 'My first to do!'
}
```

By defining the interface the compiler _ensures_ the objects have the required
properties. This means typos and missing properties will stop the app from
compiling. Catching errors at compile time is faster than catching them at
runtime and easier to debug. If you've ever had frustrating errors because you
mistyped a property, TypeScript will save you from that pain.

Modeling the data of your application is important. React is the library to take
your data and display it, but you need to define all this data yourself. A worse
alternative to consider: if a to-do is _just_ a single string, it would be
possible to model it as a list of strings.

```json
["My first to do!", "Another one"]
```

While valid, it does not allow for _other_ properties to be added. Thinking
ahead, you might want to add due dates, priority, tags, lists, and other
features. Using an object to hold the to-do information makes adding future
properties easier. **You don't need to change the data structure**. Objects in
JavaScript are also very easy to work with; there is not much downside to using
them.

Another thought would be to use a `class` to define our to do:

```tsx
class Todo {
  public text: string
  constructor(text: string) {
    this.text = text
  }
}
```

This is valid too, but **don't** do it. When defining a `class` the code must
_instantiate_ that class. You need to do:

```tsx
const todo = new Todo('My first to do!')
```

This causes problems in several places:

- Loading data from a network is harder since the data needs to be turned into class objects.
- Copying data is harder since the copy also needs to be a class object
- Saving and loading data is harder since these also need to be class objects
- Classes promote class methods, instead of functional programming

In short, never use classes. Using an `interface` defines the _shape_ of the
data, and does not require a literal class.

## Basic To-dos

Change out the `App.tsx` component to be the following:

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <ul>
    <li>Learn React</li>
    <li>Learn TypeScript</li>
    <li>Go outside </li>
  </ul>
)
```

And this should look like:

![React rendering a list of todos](/images/react/react-components-todos.png)

Hurray! You've added 3 to-dos to your app! You're basically writing HTML at this
point, there is nothing special happening in React. You can see this by
_inspecting_ the browser DOM:

![The todo dom](/images/react/react-components-dom.png)

The result is exactly what we wrote in the file. The App component is rendered
as DOM, and the HTML elements are written out. Very simple.

However, this isn't using React to its fullest potential. When written in this
way, you won't be able to _dynamically_ change the to-dos. HTML is static, but
React will let you trivially make it dynamic.

<Callout>
  üê¢ This is why using React to write a static site might be overkill. If
  nothing is dynamic, the power of React isn't really being used.
</Callout>

You're going to rewrite this component, but in a smarter way.

## Again, but with more React

First, you should remove duplication. The DOM has three list items, and in the
future, many more. How many more? **N** more. Any number zero or greater. A
to-do list can have as many items as it wants.

Because of that, you won't be able to write them all out by hand. Not to mention
you want to add new ones in the app. You need to list the items dynamically.

If you write the to-dos in the markup, `<li>my todo</li>`, then the markup
becomes the data structure. That is the only place that to-do is represented.
But that makes it very hard to work with. DOM should _show_ the data. JavaScript
should represent and manipulate the data. You want to define your to-dos in
JavaScript and s*how* them in the DOM.

To do that, near the top of the file, below the `interface Todo {...}`, write:

```tsx
const todos: Todo[] = [
  { text: 'Learn React' },
  { text: 'Learn TypeScript' },
  { text: 'Go outside' },
]
```

This defines a constant (`const`) named `todos`, which is an array of `Todo`s
(`Todo[]`). The value of that constant is the three `Todo`s in the array.

Now you need to _render_ this data in the app. You want to take the regular
JavaScript and show it to the user.

Looks tricky, but you can do it with some simple logic. You want to display
these to the user, in the browser. To do that you need to take each to-do in the
array and change it to an HTML element. Since this is a list, the `li` element
is a good option. It is a [list
item](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li).

So, for each `Todo` in the array, turn it into a `<li>`.

Imperatively, it reads like this:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  // Create a new array to hold the <li> elements
  const liElements: JSX.Element[] = []
  // for each todo
  for (const todo of todos) {
    // Add the <li> to the array, with the text of the todo
    liElements.push(<li>{todo.text}</li>)
  }

  // return the list with the liElements inside
  return <ul>{liElements}</ul>
}
```

It should look exactly the same as it did before.

### Rendering JavaScript values

In JSX, if you want to _evaluate_ a JavaScript expression, you use the syntax
`{ }`. This will evaluate the JavaScript between the brackets and render the
returned value.

For example, you could replace your `App` component with this:

```tsx
const App = () => <>{'Hello ' + (1 + 1)}</>
```

Which would display `Hello 2` in the browser. Not _all_ things evaluated can
render.

**Can Render**

- ReactElement (Component)
- string
- number
- boolean
- null (renders nothing)
- undefined (renders nothing)
- Arrays containing the above

**Cannot Render**

- Functions
- Symbols
- Objects

React will throw an error if you try to render something invalid.

### A closer look at the code

On the line:

```tsx
liElements.push(<li>{todo.text}</li>)
```

If you remove the `{ }` brackets to have:

```tsx
liElements.push(<li>todo.text</li>)
```

Then the literal text `todo.text` is what will show in the browser. You don't
want the literal string ‚Äútodo.text‚Äù, you want the `text` property on the `todo`
object. So the `{ }` brackets will _evaluate_ that as JavaScript and return the
value.

## Again, but with _more_ React

The above code with the `for loop` will let you dynamically render to-dos, but
it's not written as modern _React_. The code above is imperative, and React
wants a more declarative approach; functional.

<Callout>
  üê¢ Every library, framework, and language will have favored approaches.
  React's is to be functional and declarative. It allows for elegant and simple
  code. If this is foreign to you, I highly recommend you continue with it. It
  may take a while before it "clicks".
</Callout>

The same explanation from above:

> You want to display these to the user, in the browser. To do that you need to
> take each to-do in the array and change it to an HTML element.

When you want to change each element of an array to another ‚Äúthing‚Äù you should
use the [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method. This is one
of the most useful methods in React. It will take each `Todo` and _map_ it to
the result of a function. In our case, we'll change it to JSX:

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <ul>
    {todos.map((todo) => (
      <li>{todo.text}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
```

This more _Reactful_ approach is as elegant as it gets. The array of `todos` is
_mapped_ to the result of a function. This uses the ES 6 arrow function. The JSX
inside the `( )` is automatically returned with the arrow function. That JSX is
the `<li>` element with the todo text.

<Callout>üê¢ I know this is missing the `key` attribute. Next chapter!</Callout>

This is how it renders:

![Same rendering as before](/images/react/react-components-todos.png)

### Reviewing the code

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <ul>
    {todos.map((todo) => (
      <li>{todo.text}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
)
```

With `const App`, you define the component. There is nothing special about the
name `App`; you can name it anything you want. Since it's a top-level component
for the entire app, `App` is a good name.

You define it with `const`, instead of JavaScript's `var` or `let`. This is
because this variable will never change. You should always use `const` unless
the variable needs to mutate. React's lifecycle will run each component every
time it needs to be rendered. This means the variables won't change _inside_ a
component. You can almost always use `const` for variable declarations.

The capital `A` in `App` is important. React components either need to start
with a capital letter, or have a `.` in the name. React considers anything
starting with a lowercase letter to be an HTML element. HTML 5 allows for custom
HTML elements. Therefore, React can't know what every HTML element would be; you
can create new custom HTML elements. If you want to render HTML, make it
lowercase. If it starts with an uppercase letter then React will treat it as a
component.

HTML elements have their own basic set of properties. Components can have custom
properties. They also run your custom code to do whatever you want.

Next,

```tsx
() => (...)
```

This is the function definition. The `App` is defined as a function with no
parameters. It's an arrow function, which means if the function body is one line
then it will be automatically returned without a `return` statement. JSX inside
`( )` counts as a single statement, so the contents inside the `()` are
automatically returned. And that is:

```tsx
<ul>
  {todos.map((todo) => (
    <li>{todo.text}</li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

It's important to use semantic HTML. This is an unordered list, `ul`, with list
items, `li` inside it. Using the correct HTML elements as intended helps
accessibility and screen readers. It's also good engineering!

## Some design work

Adding some CSS will make the app feel so much better. These details matter when
convincing people to use your product. Good design is a competitive advantage.
It helps with marketing. It helps with first impressions. Products that _feel_
good are easier to sell.

<Callout>
  üë®üèº‚Äçüíª I know you came here looking to learn React. My philosophy is always to
  create a shippable product. Build something <strong>you</strong> want to use.
  These details matter.
</Callout>

There are lots of libraries to make CSS in React easier. Those will be covered
in a different section. For now, simple CSS will suffice.

Create a new file in the `src` directory named `App.css`.

```tsx
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
}

ul {
  margin: 100px auto;
  max-width: 500px;
  list-style: none;
}

li {
  padding: 0.5rem;
}

li:not(:last-child) {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

Then, in your `App.tsx` file, add:

```tsx
import './App.css'
```

## The power of components

Congratulations! You've created a static list of to-do items. You can't enter
new ones yet, but you'll be able to do that soon.

Your entire app is currently one single component, `App`. As things get more
complex, you will need to break apart the concerns into different components.

To do that, your components need to **pass data** to each other.

The first refactor will be to break apart the entire list (the `ul` element)
from each item (`li`). The list has concerns such as the order of items, sorting
items, and moving items. Each to-do itself has other concerns. They will display
the text, due dates, priority, and more.

You will make the **list** one component and the **list item** another. The list
will need to pass each to-do item the information it needs to display.

A `TodoItem` component:

```tsx
const TodoItem = ({ text }: Todo) => <li>{text}</li>
```
