It's time to get serious about building out the functionality of your app. To do
that, you're going to want to add some additional libraries that make creating a
well-designed app easier. One of the best current CSS libraries is Tailwind, a
set of utility CSS classes that you can mix and match to make your app unique.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

One of the great things about using Tailwind is it is a CSS framework, not a
React library. Therefore, using Tailwind means the time spent learning it will
transfer to another project even if that project is not written in React. For
example, Tailwind does a great job of building simple web pages and beautiful
landing pages besides full web apps.

Another great thing about Tailwind is it's very close to the underlying CSS. So
each of the classes maps to the CSS property that it manages, and it is
straightforward to peek under the hood and read the documentation to know what
Tailwind is doing.

## Setup

To set up Tailwind in Create React App, install the following dependencies.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```

Then, create the new configuration file for Tailwind.

```bash
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

### Why is a configuration file needed?

Tailwind is **more** than _just_ a CSS Framework. Tailwind has several built-in
features that make it more useful than a simple utility library.

**Auto prefixing** is a timesaving feature that allows you not to worry about
*all of the unique prefixes for browser compatibility. Tailwind will take care
*of that for you.

**Auto pruning** will automatically take out all of the CSS not being used in
*your application. This process will result in a smaller application bundle and
*better load times.

**Plugins** can be added to the configuration file, allowing you to access extra
functionality not included in the core.

**Just in time** compiling allows for you to write custom Tailwind classes and
have it compile those classes to the correct underlying CSS.

These features are possible because Tailwind monitors and watches your code as
you write and compile, allowing it to be efficient about what is included in the
final bundle.

Since you are already using TypeScript and React, there is already a build
process to get the code as written to a compiled version the browser
understands. Adding in Tailwind hooks into that process and doesn't require
additional steps.

Add your paths to the default configuration for where Tailwind will find your
source code:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Remember way back in the [getting
started](https://ethanmick.com/react/getting-started) blog post when you removed
the `index.css` file because you weren't using it? Now you want to use it.
Tailwind reads the source files of all your code and examines which classes are
used. Then, it creates a unique CSS file for your application and includes it in
the bundle. To include this custom bundle and have it available on every page,
the CSS needs to be available at the root application level. That's what the
`index.css` file is for, so recreate it and add in the following new Tailwind
directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

And then, since we removed it earlier, add it back into the `index.tsx` file.

```ts
import './index.css'
```

Now you can start the application, and you will have the power of Tailwind! Time
to start using it.
